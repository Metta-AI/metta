This stack configures the Spacelift itself.

It intentionally doesn't create stacks as [resources](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spacelift-io/spacelift/latest/docs/resources/stack), though it could.

The reason is that we want to deploy stacks on commits to `main` branch, but it's impossible to test stacks before the PR is merged.
