# External collaborator configuration
# This config provides defaults for external users
# @package __global__

# To enable specific features, uncomment and configure:

# Enable with your own wandb account:
# Option 1: Use wandb=external_user and edit configs/wandb/external_user.yaml
#   - Replace ??? placeholders with your project and entity
#   - Run: ./tools/train.py +user=external wandb=external_user run=my_experiment
#
# Option 2: Override directly in command line:
#   ./tools/train.py +user=external run=my_experiment \
#     wandb.project=my-project wandb.entity=my-username
#
# IMPORTANT: You MUST set the WANDB_ENTITY environment variable for file uploads:
#   export WANDB_ENTITY=your-username
# The WANDB_ENTITY env var is used for file uploads (replays, checkpoints)
# while wandb.entity in the config is used for metrics/logging. Both should match.

# Enable torch profiling with local storage:
# trainer:
#   profiler:
#     interval_epochs: 10000
#     upload_dir: ${run_dir}/torch_traces  # local directory

# Enable uploads to your own S3 bucket
#  - Ensure you are authenticated with aws. Our setup script should assist you with this.
# trainer:
#   profiler:
#     interval_epochs: 10000
#     upload_dir: s3://your-bucket/torch_traces
#   simulation:
#     replay_dir: s3://your-bucket/replays/${run}
