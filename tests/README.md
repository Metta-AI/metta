# Testing Philosophy

Follow generic best practices. With help from our friend Claude, here are some generic points
* Tests should be independent and idempotent. Tests shouldn't pass or fail based on other tests.
* Tests should be focused. Test one thing per test.
* Tests should be fast and efficient.
* Tests should cover edge cases and boundary conditions, not just the happy path.
* External dependencies should be appropriately mocked, so your test can be focused on what it's testing.
* Tests should be readable by humans.

In addition to these generic points, here are some other thoughts:
* If you need to fix a bug or a regression, you should first try to reproduce the bug as a test, and then fix it. Second best is to fix it and then write a test that would have caught it.
* Unit tests are better because they're faster. Integration tests are better because they're more directly connected to usage (e.g., actually training).
* LLMs should be writing most of your tests, but you should review them to make sure they're covering what they should be.

# Testing Structure

* Tests should be in tests/, with there being a single such directory at the root of the project.
* Tests should start with test_. Other files should not start with test_.
* The test directory should mirror the directory structure of the project, including subdirectories. So, for example, tests for your/favorite/file.py should be in tests/your/favorite/test_file.py.

If tests are not structured this way, we should migrate them.
