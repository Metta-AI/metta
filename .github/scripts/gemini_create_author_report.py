You are creating a performance review for {author} at a fast-moving startup with ~15 engineers.

**CONTEXT:**
We are a fast-moving team that values **shipping velocity, customer impact, and pragmatic engineering** over perfect
abstractions. Code should be clean and maintainable, but not at the cost of momentum.

- We **prioritize iterative delivery** over big rewrites.
- **Composition is favored over inheritance** — we avoid deep class hierarchies and prefer functions or small
composable objects.
- Verbose docstrings and excessive inline comments are discouraged; we prefer **clear code over redundant explanation**.
- We are working in **C++, Python, and TypeScript**.
- Python code is gradually being made safer with **incremental adoption of Pydantic and type hints**, but we still
tolerate partial coverage.
- In C++, clarity, correctness, and modern patterns matter more than exhaustive encapsulation or heavy OOP.
- In TypeScript, we prefer practical type safety over perfect type gymnastics — runtime confidence is more important
than theoretical purity.

### 🧠 Philosophy on Learning & Style:
- We prefer resources like:
  - _The Pragmatic Programmer_
  - _A Philosophy of Software Design_ by John Ousterhout
  - Short, practical blog posts or open-source code examples
- We generally avoid books like:
  - _Clean Code_ (we find it dogmatic and out of step with our realities)
  - _Working Effectively with Legacy Code_ (too heavy for our codebase size)
- Our team appreciates **opinionated, efficient solutions** — not enterprise best practices for their own sake.

### ✏️ Performance Reviews:
- Should reflect our real-world trade-offs
- Should **reward engineers who move quickly without breaking things**
- Should avoid recommending slow or heavyweight process changes unless truly necessary
- Suggestions should be **lightweight, high-leverage, and easy to apply**

**AUTHOR'S WORK STATISTICS:**
- Total PRs: {stats["total_prs"]}
- Code Changes: {stats["total_additions"]} additions, {stats["total_deletions"]} deletions across {
            stats["total_files_changed"]
        } files
- Work Distribution: {dict(stats["categories"]) if stats["categories"] else "No category data"}
- Impact Levels: {dict(stats["impact_levels"]) if stats["impact_levels"] else "No impact data"}
- Quality Scores (avg): Code {stats["avg_code_quality"]}/10, Best Practices {stats["avg_best_practices"]}/10,
Documentation {stats["avg_documentation"]}/10, Testing {stats["avg_testing"]}/10

**SAMPLE PR DETAILS:**
{json.dumps(pr_details, indent=2)}

**IDENTIFIED PATTERNS:**

Common Strengths: {
            ", ".join(set(stats["all_strengths"][:10]))
            if stats["all_strengths"]
            else "No specific strengths identified"

Areas for Growth: {
            ", ".join(set(stats["all_improvements"][:10]))
            if stats["all_improvements"]
            else "No specific improvements identified"
        }

{previous_context}

Create a balanced performance review that:
1. Celebrates shipping velocity and customer impact
2. Recognizes pragmatic trade-offs (e.g., "shipped fast to test with users")
3. Suggests improvements that won't slow down development
4. Focuses on high-impact quality improvements only
5. Avoids enterprise-style recommendations (heavy process, extensive documentation)
6. Emphasizes collaboration in a small team
7. Avoid recommending books unless truly relevant. Favor low-overhead learning methods.

**TONE:** Be encouraging and growth-focused. Avoid language like "concerning", "below expectations", or
"must improve" unless there are critical issues. Frame suggestions as "opportunities" not "deficiencies".

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

# Performance Review: {author}
**Period:** {date_range}

## Executive Summary
[2-3 paragraph overview of performance, key contributions, and overall assessment. Emphasize impact, shipping velocity,
and teamwork.]

## Experience Level Assessment
[Based on the code quality, problem-solving approach, independence, and technical sophistication demonstrated across
PRs,
estimate whether the developer is at a junior (0-2 years), mid-level (2-5), senior (5+), or staff+ level.

Focus on:
- Scope and complexity of problems tackled
- Code design and refactoring decisions
- Testing strategy and trade-offs
- Communication and initiative
- Consistency and growth over time]

## Quantitative Analysis
- **Productivity:** [PR volume, lines changed, time-to-merge — focus on sustained contribution rate]
- **Code Quality:** [Patterns in readability, maintainability, and review feedback]
- **Testing & Documentation:** [Effort spent ensuring confidence in shipped code — keep expectations realistic for
a fast-moving team]

## Progress & Improvement
[If previous reviews exist, discuss any trends in quality, impact, or behavior. Highlight both consistency and signs
of growth.]

## Key Accomplishments
[List 3-5 impactful contributions with context: why it mattered, what problems it solved, how it moved the product
forward.]

## Technical Strengths
[Highlight strong technical decisions, thoughtful trade-offs, and efficient problem solving. Look for patterns that
reflect maturity or specialization.]

## Areas for Development
[Frame this as an opportunity to level up. Focus on small changes with big upside, e.g.:
- Improving PR communication for faster reviews
- Writing slightly more test coverage for risky changes
- Sharing architectural thinking with the team
Avoid suggesting heavy process unless necessary.]

## Notable Contributions
[Spotlight 2-3 PRs that best showcase the author's technical skill, creativity, or product intuition.]

## Primary Learning Recommendation
[Choose ONE area of growth that fits the developer's current trajectory and workload. Avoid broad books unless truly
warranted. Prefer things like:
- “Add lightweight regression checks for async bugs”
- “Try mob programming on tricky PRs for faster knowledge transfer”
- “Write more descriptive commit messages to help future readers”]

## Additional Recommendations
[Optional. Only if there are clear, actionable ways to improve team-wide impact or efficiency.]

**Closing Thoughts:**
{self.get_bonus_prompt()}

Be specific, supportive, and focused on high-leverage feedback. Maximum 2000 words.
