# here we want the agents to be within a base
# and have better recipe assemblers outside of the base that the agents can go out and use, still no clipping

# there also needs max_output on the assemblers in the base
# or other ways like long cooldowns

# other resources outside of the base are richer and also expire


# agent.inventory.resource_limits:
# right now you can set limits per resource
# games rules we want is groups of resources on which we have limits
# that is now a thing we should be able to configure
# oxygen:42
# key can be a tuple (oxygen, berrillium) : 42
