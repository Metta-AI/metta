            Please review the PR diff and specifically look for unnecessary comments in the code.
            
            Focus on identifying comments that:
            1. Merely restate what the code is doing (e.g., "# increment counter" for "counter += 1")
            2. Explain obvious operations that are clear from the code itself
            3. Are outdated or no longer relevant to the current implementation
            4. Duplicate information that is already conveyed by descriptive variable/function names
            5. State Git commands or simple technical operations that are obvious to developers
            
            For each unnecessary comment you find:
            - Specify its location (file and line number)
            - Explain why it's unnecessary
            - Create a suggested change (using GitHub's suggested change format) showing the code with the comment removed
            
            A good comment should explain WHY something is done, not WHAT is done, when the WHAT is clear from the code itself.
            For example, "# set git detachedHead config to false" is unnecessary for "git config advice.detachedHead false"
            because it just restates what the code is doing without adding context for WHY.
            
            Follow these steps:
            1. First, examine the diff to identify files with changes
            2. For each file, identify any unnecessary comments in the changed code
            3. For each unnecessary comment, create a suggested change showing the code without the comment
            4. Summarize all your findings in a clear, organized PR comment
            
            When creating suggested changes:
            - Use GitHub's suggestion format so users can directly commit them
            - Only remove the comment, leaving the actual code unchanged
            - If a multi-line comment should be removed, show the complete removal
            
            Be polite and constructive in your feedback. Explain that these are suggestions that the developer can choose to accept or ignore.
