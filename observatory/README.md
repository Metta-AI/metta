# Policy Evaluation Dashboard

A web application for visualizing policy evaluation results. This currently runs similarly to 'replays',
with the data being generated by the 'sim' and 'dashboard' tools, and then passed in as a url parameter or as an
uploaded file.

   ```bash
   npm install

   ```

3. Open your browser to the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:5173?data=[DATA JSON URL])

## Production Build
