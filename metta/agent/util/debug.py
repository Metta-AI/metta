    """
    Assert that a tensor has an expected shape by raising ValueError if the shape doesn't match. This function should
    be called from within a debug block to allow optimization to skip the checks

    Args:
        tensor: The tensor to check
        expected_shape: A tuple specifying expected dimensions. Each element can be:
            - An integer: Requires the dimension to have exactly this size
            - A string: Represents a named dimension (like "B", "T", "H", "W") where any
              positive size is acceptable
        name: Optional name for the tensor to include in the error message

    Examples:
        if __debug__:
            assert_shape(x, ("B", 3, "H", "W"), 'features')
        if __debug__:
            assert_shape(logits, ("B", "T", 10000), 'logits')

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the tensor shape doesn't match the expected shape

    Returns:
        bool: True when the assertion passes
