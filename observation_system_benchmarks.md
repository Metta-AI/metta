# Observation System Benchmarks & Latent Space Analysis

## Overview

While the MettaGrid repository has **extensive evaluation suites** and **performance metrics tracking**, there are **currently no documented benchmarks specifically comparing different observation systems** or their impact on agent latent space learning. However, the repository provides a solid foundation for such benchmarks.

## Current Benchmark Infrastructure

### 1. **Evaluation Suites Available**
The repository includes comprehensive evaluation frameworks:

#### Navigation Evaluation Suite (23 environments)
- **Purpose**: Tests spatial navigation and pathfinding skills
- **Environments**: corridors, cylinder, honeypot, labyrinth, memory_palace, obstacles (0-3), radial variants, swirls, thecube, walkaround, wanderout
- **Metrics**: Completion rate, path efficiency, exploration coverage, time-to-goal

#### Arena Evaluation Suite
- **Purpose**: Tests multi-agent cooperation and competition
- **Environments**: Resource management, combat scenarios, social dynamics
- **Metrics**: Resource efficiency, combat success, cooperation rates, alliance formation

#### Systematic Exploration Memory Suite
- **Purpose**: Tests exploration strategies and spatial memory
- **Environments**: boxout, journey_home, memory_matrix, systematic_coverage
- **Metrics**: Area coverage, exploration efficiency, memory retention, backtracking frequency

### 2. **Performance Metrics Tracked**
The system tracks extensive metrics via Weights & Biases:

```python
# Core metrics from docs/wandb/metrics/overview/
overview_metrics = {
    "reward": "Mean reward per episode per agent",
    "reward_vs_total_time": "Learning efficiency (reward/second)",
    "sps": "Training throughput (steps/second)",
    "navigation_score": "Navigation performance across suite",
    "memory_score": "Memory-based task performance",
    "objectuse_score": "Object interaction capabilities"
}
```

## Missing: Observation System Benchmarks

### Current Gap Analysis

**❌ What doesn't exist:**
- Benchmarks comparing **token-based vs channel-based observations**
- Analysis of **latent space richness** across observation systems
- Performance comparisons for **different observation architectures**
- Impact assessment of **observation system design** on learning

**✅ What exists that can be leveraged:**
- Multiple evaluation environments
- Comprehensive metrics collection
- Training infrastructure
- Agent architecture flexibility

## Proposed Benchmark Framework

        }

    def benchmark_system(self, system_name: str, environments: List[str]):
        """Benchmark single observation system across environments."""
        system = self.observation_systems[system_name]

        results = {}
        for env in environments:

    """Analyze properties of learned latent representations."""

    def analyze_diversity(self, latent_vectors: torch.Tensor) -> float:
        """Measure diversity of latent representations."""
        # Compute variance across dimensions
        dimension_variance = torch.var(latent_vectors, dim=0)
        return torch.mean(dimension_variance).item()

    def analyze_spatial_preservation(self, latent_vectors: torch.Tensor,
                                   spatial_positions: torch.Tensor) -> float:
        """Measure how well spatial relationships are preserved."""
        # Compute correlation between latent and spatial distances
        latent_distances = torch.cdist(latent_vectors, latent_vectors)
        spatial_distances = torch.cdist(spatial_positions, spatial_positions)

        correlation = self.compute_correlation(latent_distances, spatial_distances)
        return correlation

    def analyze_temporal_coherence(self, latent_sequences: List[torch.Tensor]) -> float:
        """Measure consistency of representations over time."""
        coherence_scores = []
        for seq in latent_sequences:
            # Measure smoothness of latent trajectory
            smoothness = self.compute_trajectory_smoothness(seq)
            coherence_scores.append(smoothness)

        return np.mean(coherence_scores)
```

        # Compute MI using histogram-based approach
        mi = self.mutual_information(latent_discrete, ground_truth)
        return mi

    def analyze_feature_disentanglement(self, latent_matrix: torch.Tensor,
                                      feature_labels: List[str]) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Analyze how well different features are separated in latent space."""
        disentanglement_scores = {}

        for i, feature in enumerate(feature_labels):
            # Measure how much this latent dimension correlates with this feature
            correlations = []
            for dim in range(latent_matrix.shape[1]):
                corr = self.compute_correlation(
                    latent_matrix[:, dim],
                    self.get_feature_values(feature)
                )
                correlations.append(abs(corr))

            # Find the dimension with highest correlation for this feature
            max_corr_idx = np.argmax(correlations)
            max_corr = correlations[max_corr_idx]

            # Check if other dimensions have low correlation (disentanglement)
            other_corrs = [c for j, c in enumerate(correlations) if j != max_corr_idx]
            disentanglement = 1.0 - np.mean(other_corrs) / max_corr

            disentanglement_scores[feature] = disentanglement

        return disentanglement_scores
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
```bash
# 1. Create benchmark framework
mkdir experiments/benchmarks/observation_systems/

# 2. Implement observation system wrappers
# TokenBasedObservation, ChannelBasedObservation, HybridObservation

# 3. Create latent space analysis tools

# 4. Set up evaluation pipelines
# Automated training and evaluation across systems
```

### Phase 2: Core Benchmarks

benchmark_configs = {
    "navigation_suite": {
        "environments": ["corridors", "labyrinth", "memory_palace"],
        "metrics": ["completion_rate", "path_efficiency", "learning_speed"],
        "latent_analysis": ["spatial_preservation", "temporal_coherence"]
    },

    "exploration_suite": {
        "environments": ["systematic_coverage", "memory_matrix", "journey_home"],
        "metrics": ["exploration_coverage", "memory_retention", "efficiency"],
        "latent_analysis": ["representation_diversity", "information_density"]
    },

    "arena_suite": {

    report = "# Observation System Benchmark Results\n\n"

    # Performance comparison
    report += "## Performance Comparison\n"
    report += generate_performance_table(results)

    # Latent space analysis
    report += "## Latent Space Analysis\n"
    report += generate_latent_analysis(results)

    # Efficiency comparison
    report += "## Efficiency Analysis\n"
    report += generate_efficiency_analysis(results)

    # Recommendations
    report += "## Recommendations\n"
    report += generate_recommendations(results)

    return report
```

## Expected Insights

### 1. **Observation System Trade-offs**
- **Token-based**: Lower memory usage, faster processing, but potentially less rich representations
- **Channel-based**: Higher memory usage, richer representations, potentially better learning
- **Hybrid approaches**: Balance between efficiency and representational power

### 2. **Task-Specific Performance**
- **Navigation tasks**: May benefit from spatial channel representations
- **Memory tasks**: May require temporal channel persistence
- **Multi-agent tasks**: May benefit from social channel encodings

### 3. **Latent Space Characteristics**
- **Dimensionality requirements**: How many dimensions needed for different tasks
- **Feature disentanglement**: How well different aspects are separated
- **Temporal stability**: Consistency of representations over time
- **Generalization capability**: Transfer learning across environments

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

### Leveraging Current Tools
```python
# Use existing evaluation framework
from experiments.evals.navigation import NavigationEvaluator
from experiments.evals.systematic_exploration_memory import ExplorationEvaluator

# Extend with observation system comparison
class ObservationSystemEvaluator:
    def __init__(self, observation_systems: Dict[str, BaseObservation]):
        self.systems = observation_systems
        self.base_evaluators = {
            "navigation": NavigationEvaluator(),
            "exploration": ExplorationEvaluator()
        }

    def run_comparison(self, environments: List[str]) -> Dict:
        """Run comprehensive comparison across systems and environments."""
        results = {}

        for system_name, system in self.systems.items():
            system_results = {}

            for env_name in environments:
                # Use existing evaluator with custom observation system
                evaluator = self.base_evaluators.get(env_name.split('_')[0])
                if evaluator:
                    metrics = evaluator.evaluate_with_system(system, env_name)
                    system_results[env_name] = metrics

            results[system_name] = system_results

        return results
```

## Research Opportunities

## Conclusion

While **specific observation system benchmarks don't currently exist** in the repository, the infrastructure is well-positioned to support them. The combination of:

- **Comprehensive evaluation suites** (navigation, exploration, arena)
- **Rich metrics collection** (performance, learning efficiency, memory)
- **Flexible agent architecture** (support for different observation systems)
- **Training infrastructure** (curriculum learning, distributed training)

Provides an excellent foundation for implementing observation system benchmarks that can answer critical questions about:

1. **How do different observation systems affect learning performance?**
2. **What are the trade-offs between efficiency and representational power?**
3. **How does observation system design impact latent space quality?**
4. **Which observation systems work best for different types of tasks?**

This would provide valuable insights for both practical agent development and theoretical understanding of representation learning in reinforcement learning systems.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement the benchmark framework** outlined above
2. **Run initial comparisons** between token-based and channel-based systems
3. **Analyze latent space properties** across different architectures
4. **Publish findings** and use insights to guide future development

The repository's modular design makes this type of comparative analysis particularly feasible and valuable for advancing the state of agent learning systems.
