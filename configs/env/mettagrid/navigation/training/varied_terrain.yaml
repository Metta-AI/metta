# This YAML file configures the grid world environment using the VariedTerrainLabyrinths class.
# It scatters several types of obstacles:
#  - Large obstacles (random shapes with target block counts),
#  - Small obstacles (similarly generated),
#  - Cross obstacles (cross-shaped patterns),
#  - Mini labyrinths (mazes no larger than 10Ã—10 with random border gaps and hearts scattered inside).
# Additionally, single wall cells (scattered walls) are randomly placed over the grid.
# The number of heart altars is sampled between 50 and 100.
# Other parameters (room dimensions, obstacle counts, clumpiness) are specified below.
