## High Priority Issues

### 1. Job Registration Reliability (job_helpers.py:379-380) ✅ FIXED
**Reviewer:** @berekuk
**Status:** **COMPLETED**
**Location:** `devops/skypilot/utils/job_helpers.py`

**Issue:** Using `time.sleep()` to wait for job registration is unreliable.

**Fix Applied:** Replaced `time.sleep()` with `retry_function` with exponential backoff
- Updated `get_job_id_from_request_id()` to use retry logic with up to 5 retries
- Updated `open_job_log_from_request_id()` to use retry logic
- Added proper error handling with `ValueError` when job ID is not yet registered

**Priority:** High - reliability concern

---

### 2. Return Value Usage (job_helpers.py) ✅ VERIFIED
**Reviewer:** @berekuk
**Status:** **COMPLETED** (Already correct)
**Location:** `devops/skypilot/utils/job_helpers.py`

**Issue:** Error message return values from helper functions aren't being used in `launch.py`

**Resolution:** Upon inspection, the return values ARE being used correctly:
- `check_git_state()` returns `str | None` and is properly checked in `launch.py:219-223`
- Error messages are printed and cause script to exit when validation fails
- No changes needed - the code was already correct

**Priority:** Medium - error handling concern

---

## Type Safety Improvements

### 3. Termination Reason Type Safety ✅ FIXED
**Reviewer:** @berekuk
**Status:** **COMPLETED**

**Issue:** `termination_reason` is currently a string, should be a typed dataclass with enum

**Fix Applied:**
- Created `TerminationReason` enum with all termination reason values
- Updated all monitors to use enum values instead of plain strings
- Updated `skypilot_run.py` to use enum throughout
- Added helper methods for dynamic reason creation (`with_exit_code`, `parse_os_error`, `parse_unexpected_error`)
- Provides better IDE autocomplete, catches typos at dev time, and clarifies valid termination reasons

**Priority:** Medium - technical debt

---

### 4. Monitor Abstract Base Class ✅ FIXED
**Reviewer:** @berekuk
**Status:** **COMPLETED**
**Location:** `devops/skypilot/utils/runtime_monitors.py`

**Issue:** Monitors lack a common abstract base class with typed `check_condition` method

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `Monitor` abstract base class with typed `check_condition(self) -> str | None` method
- Updated all monitor classes to inherit from `Monitor` ABC
- Simplified monitor return types from `tuple[bool, Optional[str]]` to just `str | None`
- Updated `skypilot_run.py` to use the simplified return type

**Priority:** Medium - technical debt

---

## Code Simplification

### 5. Monitor Name Property ✅ FIXED
**Reviewer:** @berekuk
**Status:** **COMPLETED**
**Location:** `devops/skypilot/utils/runtime_monitors.py`

**Issue:** Each monitor class defines a `name` property manually

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed manual `name` property from each monitor class
- Added `@property` method in `Monitor` ABC that uses `self.__class__.__name__`
- All monitors now automatically get their name from their class name

**Priority:** Low - code simplification

---

### 6. Virtual Environment Defensive Code ✅ FIXED
**Reviewer:** @berekuk
**Status:** **COMPLETED**
**Location:** `devops/skypilot/recipes/skypilot_run.yaml`

**Issue:** Defensive venv deactivation code should be removed

**Fix Applied:** Removed the defensive venv deactivation code:
```yaml
# Removed:
if [ -n "$VIRTUAL_ENV" ]; then
    deactivate 2>/dev/null || true
fi
```

**Rationale:** Image correctness should be tested when built, not when used

**Priority:** Low - code cleanup

---

## Naming and Organization

### 7. Client/Server Code Separation
**Reviewer:** @berekuk
**Status:** Open (acknowledged by @rjwalters as follow-up work)

**Issue:** Need clearer separation between client-side code (`job_helpers`) and server-side code (`skypilot/utils/`, `skypilot/launch/`)

**Suggested Naming:**
- Option 1: `client/` vs `server/`
- Option 2: Other clear naming convention

**Priority:** Low - can be addressed in follow-up PR

---

### 8. Rename skypilot_run.yaml to job.yaml
**Reviewer:** @berekuk
**Status:** Open (acknowledged by @rjwalters as follow-up work)

**Issue:** `skypilot_run.yaml` would be clearer as `job.yaml`

**Priority:** Low - can be addressed in follow-up PR

---

## Additional Context from Reviews

### Changes Requested Reviews

1. **@berekuk (2025-09-02):** "Request changes" - minor comments, most significant about heartbeat code duplication
   - Also suggested folding `run.sh` into `skypilot_run.py` - they're too tightly coupled

2. **@daveey (2025-09-05):** "Request changes" - See detailed comments below in "daveey's Review Comments" section

### Final Approval

**@berekuk (2025-09-26):** Approved with recommendations
- Monitors pattern and `skypilot_run.py` are well-organized
- `JobConfig` and env vars could be simplified (evolved from shell scripts)
- Recommends merging soon and continuing improvements in other branches

## daveey's Review Comments (2025-09-05)

### 9. Notification Service Separation ✅ FIXED
**Reviewer:** @daveey
**Status:** **COMPLETED**
**Location:** `devops/skypilot/notifications/`

**Issue:** NotificationSender should be broken up into per-service classes

**Fix Applied:** (Commit: 7c3673e820 "break notifications into components")
- Created separate notification modules:
  - `discord.py` - Discord webhook notifications
  - `github.py` - GitHub status updates
  - `wandb.py` - Weights & Biases integration
  - `notifier.py` - Base NotificationConfig class
  - `orchestrator.py` - Coordinates notifications
- Each service is now independently configurable
- Removed monolithic NotificationSender pattern

**Priority:** Medium - code organization

---

### 10. Environment Variable Management
**Reviewer:** @daveey
**Status:** Open (needs discussion)
**Location:** `devops/skypilot/utils/configure_environment.py`

**Issue:** Should use .env file instead of reading environment variables directly

**Questions:**
- Why is configure_environment reading env vars instead of receiving data from call site?
- Should this be moved to a .env file approach?

**Priority:** Low - can be addressed in follow-up

---

### 11. Configure Environment Executable
**Reviewer:** @daveey
**Status:** Open (needs discussion)
**Location:** `devops/skypilot/utils/configure_environment.py`

**Issue:** Make configure_environment executable and run with `uv run`

**Priority:** Low - code organization

---

### 12. Setup Code Duplication ✅ FIXED
**Reviewer:** @daveey
**Status:** **COMPLETED**
**Location:** `devops/skypilot/recipes/skypilot_run.yaml`, `devops/skypilot/recipes/sandbox.yaml`

**Issue:** Setup code is copy-pasted between sandbox and skypilot_run YAML files

**Fix Applied:** Created shared `devops/skypilot/recipes/setup.sh` script
- Both YAML files now reference: `bash <(curl -fsSL ".../${METTA_GIT_REF}/devops/skypilot/recipes/setup.sh")`
- Eliminates duplication between sandbox and skypilot_run configurations
- Single source of truth for setup logic

**Priority:** Medium - reduce duplication

---

### 13. Restart Count Tracking
**Reviewer:** @daveey
**Status:** Open (needs discussion)
**Location:** `devops/skypilot/utils/configure_environment.py`

**Issue:** Why track restart count? If limiting restarts is needed, should tell SkyPilot directly

**Priority:** Low - design question

---

### 14. NCCL Test Necessity
**Reviewer:** @daveey
**Status:** Open (needs discussion)
**Location:** `devops/skypilot/utils/nccl_tests.py`

**Issue:** Why do we want these tests? Has NCCL ever failed?

**Priority:** Low - testing strategy question

---

### 15. Launch Script Verbosity
**Reviewer:** @daveey
**Status:** Open (needs discussion)
**Location:** `devops/skypilot/launch.py`

**Issue:** Script always prints cluster ID; should add --verbose or --print-id flag instead

**Concern:** Interrupts pasting multiple commands

**Priority:** Low - UX improvement

---
