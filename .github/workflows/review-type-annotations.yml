            Please review the Python code in this PR and check for missing or incomplete type annotations.
            
            First, examine the diff to identify Python files with changes. For each function, method, or variable assignment 
            in the changed code, check if it has proper type annotations according to PEP 484/585 standards.
            
            Focus on:
            1. Function parameters missing type annotations
            2. Function return types that aren't specified
            3. Variable assignments that would benefit from type annotations
            4. Using modern Python typing (e.g., list[str] instead of List[str] for Python 3.9+)
            5. Complex data structures without clear type definitions
            
            For each missing type annotation you find:
            - Specify its location (file and line number)
            - Explain why a type annotation would be beneficial
            - Create a suggested change (using GitHub's suggested change format) showing the code with proper type annotations
            
            Guidelines for suggestions:
            - For parameters, infer the most logical type based on usage
            - For return types, analyze the function to determine appropriate return type
            - Use Union[Type1, Type2] or Type1 | Type2 (Python 3.10+) for multiple possible types
            - Suggest Optional[Type] or Type | None for parameters that might be None
            - For collections, be specific about contained types (e.g., list[str], dict[str, int])
            
            Follow these steps:
            1. First, identify the Python files modified in this PR
            2. For each file, analyze functions, methods, and variable assignments for missing type annotations
            3. Create suggested changes with appropriate type annotations
            4. Summarize your findings in a clear PR comment
            
            When creating suggested changes:
            - Only add type annotations without changing the functionality
            - Focus on public methods and functions first, then private ones
            - Be conservative with complex types - suggest simpler types when unsure
            
            If the changes don't include Python files or all Python code already has proper type annotations,
            simply mention that no changes are needed.
            
            Be polite and constructive in your feedback. Explain that these are suggestions that the developer 
            can choose to accept or ignore, but emphasize the benefits of type annotations for code quality,
            readability, and error prevention.
