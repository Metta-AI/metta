# # Hello World: Your First Metta AI Experiment
#
# Welcome to your first reinforcement learning experiment with Metta AI. This notebook will guide you through creating, observing, evaluating, and training AI agents in a gridworld environment.
#
# ## What You'll Learn
#
# By the end of this notebook, you'll be able to:
# - Create and understand ASCII maps
# - Choose and observe different agent policies
# - Evaluate agent performance quantitatively
# - Train a new agent from scratch
# - Compare trained vs untrained agents
#
# ## 1. Setup
#
# Let's load dependencies and set up some scaffolding. Don't worry about the details here.

# ## 2. Defining a Map and an Environment
#
# In Metta AI, an **environment** is the virtual world where our agents live, learn, and act. Think of it as the "game world" where we observe and train AI agents.
#
# ### Building Our Environment: Two Parts
#
# **1. The Map (Physical Layout)**
# Maps define where agents can move and what objects they encounter:

# %%
hallway_map = """
############
#@........m#
############"""

# %% [markdown]
# - `#` = walls that block movement
# - `@` = where the agent starts
# - `.` = empty spaces where agents can walk
# - `m` = a mine that generates collectible ore
#
# **2. The Environment Configuration (Game Rules)**
# The map is just the layout - we also need to define the "rules of the game":

# %%
# Write the ASCII map to a file for renderer's file-based loader
# Define map file path under debug maps directory
map_path = repo_root / "configs" / "env" / "mettagrid" / "maps" / "debug" / "notebook_hallway.map"
with open(map_path, "w") as f:
    f.write(hallway_map)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Key Environment Defaults We're Using
#
# Our configuration only specifies the map and basic settings. The environment automatically provides sensible defaults for:
#
# **Available Actions:**
# - `move` - Navigate in 8 directions (cardinal + diagonal)
# - `rotate` - Change facing direction
# - `get_items` - Pick up resources from objects like mines
# - `put_items` - Drop items (useful for complex tasks)
# - `attack` - Combat actions (disabled in our peaceful hallway)
#
# **Resource System:**
# - **Inventory**: Agents can carry up to 50 of each resource type
# - **Ore Collection**: Mines generate `ore_red` that agents can collect
# - **Rewards**: Collecting ore gives small positive rewards to encourage the behavior
#
# **Observation System:**
# - **Vision**: Agents see an 11x11 grid around themselves
# - **Inventory Awareness**: Agents know what resources they're carrying
# - **Action Feedback**: Agents receive information about their last action's success
#
# **Object Behaviors:**
# - **Mines**: Automatically generate ore over time with cooldown periods
# - **Walls**: Block movement and create boundaries
# - **Resource Limits**: Objects have maximum output to prevent infinite resource generation
#
# ### What This Environment Tests:
# - **Navigation**: Can the agent move from start (`@`) to mine (`m`)?
# - **Resource Collection**: Will the agent use the `get_items` action to collect ore?
# - **Efficiency**: Does the agent learn direct paths vs random wandering?
#
# Our environment uses these default settings with only a custom map layout, giving us a working world with minimal configuration.



# %% [markdown]
# ## 3. Observing Our Agent
#
# Now that we have our environment set up, let's watch an agent explore it!
#
# ### Our Opportunistic Agent
# We'll use a simple "opportunistic" policy that:
# - Moves randomly around the environment
# - Always picks up resources when available
# - Provides a baseline for comparison with trained agents

# %%
import ipywidgets as widgets
from IPython.display import display

# Load and override configuration in memory
cfg = OmegaConf.load(str(repo_root / "configs" / "renderer_job.yaml"))
cfg.renderer_job.environment.root.params.uri = str(map_path)
cfg.renderer_job.policy_type = "opportunistic"
cfg.renderer_job.num_steps = 150
cfg.renderer_job.sleep_time = 0.15
cfg.renderer_job.num_agents = 1

# Build environment and policy
env, render_mode = setup_environment(cfg)
policy = get_policy(cfg.renderer_job.policy_type, env, cfg)

# Create reactive widgets
header = widgets.HTML()
map_box = widgets.HTML()
display(header, map_box)

obs, info = env.reset()
total_reward = 0.0
for step in range(cfg.renderer_job.num_steps):
    actions = policy.predict(obs)
    obs, rewards, terminals, truncations, info = env.step(actions)
    total_reward += rewards.sum()
    # Update header and map in place
    header.value = f"<b>Score:</b> {total_reward:.1f} | <b>Step:</b> {step+1}/{cfg.renderer_job.num_steps}"
    map_box.value = f"<pre>{env.render() or ''}</pre>"
    if cfg.renderer_job.sleep_time:
        time.sleep(cfg.renderer_job.sleep_time)
env.close()

# %% [markdown]
# ### What You'll See:
# - The agent (`0`) moving around the hallway
# - Real-time score and resource collection updates
# - The agent collecting ore from the mine (`m`)
# - Random movement patterns as the agent explores
#
# This gives us a baseline understanding of how agents behave in our environment before we move on to evaluation and training.
#
# When you're ready to keep going, stop the cell above and continue to the next step.
#
# ## 4. Configuring an Evaluation Environment
#
# Now that we've observed our agent, let's formally evaluate its performance.
#
# **Evaluation** is the process of measuring how well an agent performs on a specific task.
# To create a good evaluation environment, we need to define:
# - **Clear success criteria**: What does it mean to "win"?
# - **Controlled conditions**: Same task every time
# - **Measurable outcomes**: Numbers we can compare
# - **Reasonable limits**: Time/steps to prevent infinite loops
#
# For our ore collection task, we'll configure the environment to track ore collection and provide appropriate rewards.

# ## 5. Deciding on Metrics
#
# Now that we have our evaluation environment, we need to decide **what to measure**.
#
# **Evaluation metrics** are the numbers that tell us how well our agent performs. Choosing the right metrics is crucial because they determine what we consider "success."
#
# ### What Should We Measure?
#
# For our ore collection task, we want to measure:
#
# **Ore Collection**: How much ore does the agent collect per episode?
#
# This is a simple, direct metric that tests the agent's ability to:
# - Navigate to the mine at the end of the hallway
# - Use the `get_items` action to collect ore
# - Return to the mine repeatedly to collect more ore
#
# ### Why This Metric Matters
#
# - **Simple**: Easy to understand and measure
# - **Direct**: Directly tests the agent's core task
# - **Scalable**: Trained agents should collect significantly more ore
# - **Realistic**: Tests both navigation and resource collection skills
#
# ### What We Expect from the Simple Agent
#
# Since the simple agent moves randomly and only has a 10% chance to try pickup actions:
# - **Low ore collection** (maybe 0.5-2.0 ore per episode) due to random movement and infrequent collection attempts
# - **Inefficient**: Will often wander away from the mine after collecting
# - **Inconsistent**: Some episodes will get lucky, others will get none
#
# This will give us a baseline to compare against when we later train an agent.

# %%
# Define our evaluation metric
evaluation_metric = {
    "ore_collection": {
        "description": "Average ore collected per episode",
        "calculation": "total_ore_collected / total_episodes",
        "expected_simple": "0.5-2.0 ore per episode"
    }
}

# %% [markdown]
# ## 6. Creating a Simulation Suite
#
# Now that we have our evaluation environment and metrics defined, we need to create a **simulation suite**.
#
# **Simulation suites** are collections of evaluation environments that sim.py uses to test agents. They define:
# - Which environments to test in
# - How many episodes to run per environment
# - What metrics to collect
#
# For our ore collection task, we'll create a custom simulation suite that uses our hallway environment.

# %%
# Create a custom simulation suite for our hallway ore collection task
hallway_simulation_suite = {
    "name": "hallway_ore_collection",
    "simulations": {
        "hallway/ore_collection": {
            "env": hallway_eval_config,  # Use the config directly
            "num_episodes": 100  # Run 100 episodes for good statistics
        }
    }
}

# %% [markdown]
# ## 7. Running the Evaluation
#
# Now let's run our evaluation. We'll use `sim.py` to test the simple agent in our ore collection environment and see how it performs.
#
# **What we're doing:**
# - Running the simple agent through multiple episodes
# - Collecting data on ore collection performance
# - Visualizing the results to understand baseline performance
#
# This will give us a baseline to compare against when we later train an agent.

# ## 8. Introducing Training
#
# So far we've been observing agents with pre-defined behaviors. Now we'll create something new - a **trained agent** that learns from experience!
#
# **Training** is the process of teaching an agent to improve its behavior through trial and error. The agent starts with random actions and gradually learns which actions lead to better outcomes (more ore collection in our case).
#
# Our hypothesis: A trained agent should learn to navigate directly to the mine and collect ore much more efficiently than the simple agent.
#
# Let's set up our first training run!

# %% [markdown]
# ## 9. Configuring Training
#
# Before we start training, we need to configure our training run. This includes:
# - **Environment**: Our hallway map

# - **Learning Parameters**: How the agent learns
