# Global Observation Configuration Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of configurable global observation tokens in the mettagrid game.

## What Was Implemented (Python Side)

### 1. Configuration Models (`mettagrid_config.py`)
- Added `PyGlobalObsConfig` class with three boolean fields:
  - `episode_completion_pct`: Controls inclusion of episode completion percentage token
  - `last_action`: Controls inclusion of both last_action and last_action_arg tokens
  - `last_reward`: Controls inclusion of last reward token
- Added `global_obs` field to `PyGameConfig` as optional configuration

### 2. Configuration Conversion (`mettagrid_c_config.py`)
- Updated `from_mettagrid_config` to handle global_obs configuration
- Converts Python config to C++ parameters:
  - `include_episode_completion_pct`
  - `include_last_action`
  - `include_last_reward`
- Provides default values (all True) when global_obs is not specified

### 3. YAML Configuration (`mettagrid.yaml`)
- Added `global_obs` section with all three configuration options
- Default values are all `true` to maintain backward compatibility

## Usage Examples

### In YAML Configuration:
```yaml
game:
  global_obs:
    episode_completion_pct: true
    last_action: true  # Controls both last_action and last_action_arg
    last_reward: false
```

### Programmatically:
```python
config = {
    "game": {
        "global_obs": {
            "episode_completion_pct": False,
            "last_action": True,
            "last_reward": True
        }
        # ... other config
    }
}
```

## What Remains to be Done (C++ Side)

The C++ implementation needs to be updated to support these configuration options. See `cpp_changes_needed.md` for detailed instructions on:

1. Adding configuration fields to GameConfig struct
2. Updating pybind11 bindings
3. Storing configuration in MettaGrid class
4. Modifying observation computation to respect configuration
5. Updating type annotations in mettagrid_c.pyi

## Building

After implementing the C++ changes, rebuild with:
```bash
uv sync
```

## Benefits

This implementation allows researchers to:
- Reduce observation space by disabling unneeded global tokens
- Experiment with different observation configurations
- Maintain backward compatibility (all tokens enabled by default)
