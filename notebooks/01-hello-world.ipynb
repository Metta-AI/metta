        "\n",
        "  1. A Map -- the physical layout of the environment where agents can move and what objects they encounter. One simple way to define a map is to use a simple ASCII string. This much ASCII will get us started:\n",
        "      - `#` = walls that block movement\n",
        "      - `@` = where the agent starts\n",
        "      - `.` = empty spaces where agents can walk\n",
        "      - `m` = a mine that generates collectible ore\n",
        "  2. Game Rules -- what actions are available and how rewards are calculated. We express these rules through environment configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "For now, we'll mostly rely on the default set of game rules, as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Agents Can Observe:**\n",
        "- **Vision**: Agents see an 11x11 grid around themselves\n",
        "- **Awareness**: Agents know what resources they're carrying\n",
        "- **Feedback**: Agents receive information about their last action's success\n",

        "**Agents Can Act:**\n",
        "- Navigate in 8 directions (cardinal + diagonal) and rotate\n",
        "- Pick up & carry resources from objects like mines, or drop items\n",
        "- Interact with other agents -- we'll ignore this for now and just start with a single agent\n",
        "\n",
        "**Agents Encounter Objects:**\n",
        "- **Walls**: Block movement and create boundaries\n",
        "- **Mines**: Automatically generate ore over time\n",
        "- **Ore**: Collectible resources that agents can carry and trade for rewards\n",
        "- **Rewards**: Collecting ore gives small positive rewards that can be used to reinforce behavior\n",
        "\n",
        "In our environment, we'll also need an agent (sometimes referred to as a \"policy\") who can take action.\n",
        "We'll try out a very simple \"opportunistic\" agent that moves randomly around the environment. If it encounters\n",

        "\n",
        "### 4.2 Choosing a metric\n",

        "2. **Monotonic** – more ore ⇒ higher score.\n",
        "3. **Reward-friendly** – the environment can hand out a small reward each time inventory grows, which is useful later when we train.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.3 Hooking the metric into the config\n",
        "Metta-ai's env config already supports inventory-based rewards. We enable it with:\n",

        "1. Run *N* episodes (default 100) with the current policy.\n",
        "2. Record the episode return (our *score*) after each run.\n",
        "3. Report the mean and standard deviation.\n",
