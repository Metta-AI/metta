# Quick Start: PR Splitting with Gitta

This guide will help you get started with splitting large PRs using gitta.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install gitta:**

   ```bash
   pip install gitta
   ```

2. **Get an Anthropic API key:**

   - Sign up at https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Create an API key
   - Set it as an environment variable:
     ```bash
     export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
     ```

3. **Optional: Set up GitHub token for auto PR creation:**
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Create a token with `repo` scope
   - Set it as an environment variable:
     ```bash
     export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_..."
     ```
4. **Optional: Choose a specific Claude model:**
   - Defaults to `claude-sonnet-4-5`
   - Override via environment variable or CLI flag:
     ```bash
     export GITTA_SPLIT_MODEL="claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"
     # or
     python -m gitta.split --model claude-3-7-sonnet-latest
     ```
5. **Optional: Control git hooks / commit timeout:**
   - Skip hooks with `export GITTA_SKIP_HOOKS="1"`
   - Extend timeout with `export GITTA_COMMIT_TIMEOUT="600"`

## Basic Usage

### Command Line

The easiest way to split a PR is from the command line:

```bash
# Navigate to your repository
cd my-project

# Make sure you're on the branch you want to split
git checkout feature/big-refactor

# Run the splitter
python -m gitta.split
# ...override the model or hooks inline
python -m gitta.split --model claude-3-7-sonnet-latest --skip-hooks --commit-timeout 600
```

## What Happens

When you run the splitter, it will:

1. **Analyze your changes** - Get the diff between your branch and the base branch
2. **Use AI to decide the split** - Claude analyzes the files and suggests logical groupings
3. **Show the split plan** - You'll see which files go into each PR
4. **Create two new branches** - Named `<your-branch>-part1` and `<your-branch>-part2`
5. **Apply the changes** - Each branch gets its subset of changes
6. **Push to origin** - Both branches are pushed
7. **Create PRs** - If you have a GitHub token, PRs are created automatically

## Example Output

```
üîÑ Starting PR split process...
üìç Current branch: feature/big-refactor
üìç Base branch: origin/main
üì• Getting diff...
üìä Found 8 changed files

üìã Split Decision:
Group 1 (4 files): Refactor authentication system
  Files: auth.py, login.py, session.py, test_auth.py
  Description: Updates core authentication logic and session handling

Group 2 (4 files): Add user profile features
  Files: profile.py, views.py, templates/profile.html, test_profile.py
  Description: Implements user profile viewing and editing

## Tips

1. **Review before pushing** - The tool shows the split plan before creating branches
2. **Check the PRs** - Always review the created PRs before merging
3. **Keep your original branch** - It's preserved as a backup
4. **Works best with 2-20 files** - Very large PRs might need manual adjustment
5. **Logical grouping** - The AI tries to keep related changes together

## Troubleshooting

### "Not in a git repository"

Make sure you're in a git repository with commits.

### "Could not determine base branch"

The tool looks for `main`, `master`, or `develop`. If you use a different base:

```python
splitter = PRSplitter()
splitter.base_branch = "origin/your-base-branch"
splitter.split()
```

### "No changes detected"

Make sure you have uncommitted changes or commits not in the base branch.

### API Key Issues

Verify your API key:

```bash
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  # Should show your key
```

### Deprecation warning about the model

If you see a warning that the Claude model is deprecated, set `GITTA_SPLIT_MODEL` (or pass `--model`) to a newer
`*-latest` alias so future runs automatically stay on a supported release.

### Commit timed out or hook is slow

Set `GITTA_SKIP_HOOKS=1` (or pass `--skip-hooks`) to append `--no-verify`, and/or raise `GITTA_COMMIT_TIMEOUT` (or
`--commit-timeout`) to give hooks more time.

### GitHub PR Creation Failed

- Check your GitHub token has `repo` scope
- Make sure the remote is set to a GitHub repository
- Verify you have push access to the repository

## Next Steps

- Read the full documentation in the README
- Check out the examples directory
- Customize the AI prompts for your project's needs
- Integrate into your CI/CD workflow
