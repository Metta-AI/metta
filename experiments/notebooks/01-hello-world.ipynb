    "## 2. Defining an Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In Metta AI, an **environment** is the virtual world where our agents act and learn. It has 2 main elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. A Map -- the physical layout of the environment where agents can move and what objects they encounter. One simple way to define a map is to use a simple ASCII string. This much ASCII will get us started:\n",
    "      - `#` = walls that block movement\n",
    "      - `@` = where the agent starts\n",
    "      - `.` = empty spaces where agents can walk\n",
    "      - `m` = a mine that generates collectible ore\n",
    "  2. Game Rules -- what actions are available and how rewards are calculated. We express these rules through environment configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we'll mostly rely on the default set of game rules, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents Can Observe:**\n",
    "- **Vision**: Agents see an 11x11 grid around themselves\n",
    "- **Awareness**: Agents know what resources they're carrying\n",
    "- **Feedback**: Agents receive information about their last action's success\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents Can Act:**\n",
    "- Navigate in 8 directions (cardinal + diagonal) and rotate\n",
    "- Pick up & carry resources from objects like mines, or drop items\n",
    "- Interact with other agents -- we'll ignore this for now and just start with a single agent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents Encounter Objects:**\n",
    "- **Walls**: Block movement and create boundaries\n",
    "- **Mines**: Automatically generate ore over time\n",
    "- **Ore**: Collectible resources that agents can carry and trade for rewards\n",
    "- **Rewards**: Collecting ore gives small positive rewards that can be used to reinforce behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "In our environment, we'll also need an agent (sometimes referred to as a \"policy\") who can take action.\n",
    "We'll try out a very simple \"opportunistic\" agent that moves randomly around the environment. If it encounters\n",
    "a resource, it will usually (but not always) pick it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following cell we'll lay out the map in ASCII, configure the environment to use it, and choose the opportunistic agent. We'll also set:\n",
    "- How many steps to run the simulation for\n",
    "- How long to sleep between steps\n",
    "- Some other basic parameters"

    "\n",
    "Now that we have our evaluation environment, we need to decide **what to measure**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation metrics** are the numbers that tell us how well our agent performs. Choosing the right metrics is crucial because they determine what we consider \"success.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Should We Measure?\n",
    "\n",
    "For our ore collection task, we want to measure:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ore Collection**: How much ore does the agent collect per episode?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple, direct metric that tests the agent's ability to:\n",
    "- Navigate to the mine at the end of the hallway\n",
    "- Use the `get_items` action to collect ore\n",
    "- Return to the mine repeatedly to collect more ore\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Metric Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple**: Easy to understand and measure\n",
    "- **Direct**: Directly tests the agent's core task\n",
    "- **Scalable**: Trained agents should collect significantly more ore\n",
    "- **Realistic**: Tests both navigation and resource collection skills\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Expect from the Simple Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the simple agent moves randomly and only has a 10% chance to try pickup actions:\n",
    "- **Low ore collection** (maybe 0.5-2.0 ore per episode) due to random movement and infrequent collection attempts\n",
    "- **Inefficient**: Will often wander away from the mine after collecting\n",
    "- **Inconsistent**: Some episodes will get lucky, others will get none\n",
