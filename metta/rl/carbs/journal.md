# MettaProtein Transition Journal

## Changes Made So Far

- **Created `MettaProtein` class** in `metta/rl/carbs/metta_protein.py` as a drop-in replacement for CARBS-based sweeps, inheriting from `Protein`.
- **Refactored sweep config** to use the pufferlib/Protein format (fields: `min`, `max`, `scale`, `mean`, `distribution`) for compatibility with the Protein optimizer.
- **Updated config loading logic** in `MettaProtein` to robustly extract and convert OmegaConf configs to plain Python dicts, and to ensure `metric` and `goal` fields are present.
- **Created a minimal test script** (`test_metta_protein_sweep.py`) to load the sweep config, instantiate `MettaProtein`, and test parameter suggestion and observation.
- **Identified and began addressing type issues** with numeric values in the sweep config (YAML sometimes loads numbers as strings, which causes errors in Protein's parameter classes).

## Next Steps (After PR Integration)

1. **Ensure all numeric values in sweep configs are real numbers** (not strings) to avoid type errors in Protein's parameter classes. Implement or finalize a utility to coerce numeric-looking strings to floats/ints.
2. **Expand and validate sweep configs** for more complex experiments, ensuring compatibility with the Protein optimizer.
3. **Integrate `MettaProtein` into the main training/evaluation workflow** as a replacement for CARBS sweeps.
4. **Test end-to-end sweep runs** and address any remaining issues with parameter suggestion, observation, or config parsing.
5. **(Optional) Add custom logic or hooks** to `MettaProtein` if project-specific sweep behavior is needed.
