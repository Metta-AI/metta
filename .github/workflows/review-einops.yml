            Please review the Python diff for PyTorch tensor operations that perform dimension reordering or reshaping via calls like `permute`, `transpose`, `view`, `reshape`, or `unsqueeze`.
            When you find a sequence of such operations that could be expressed more clearly with `einops.rearrange`, create a GitHub suggestion using `einops.rearrange` to accomplish the same transformation.
            Explain briefly why `einops.rearrange` is preferable.
            Keep suggestions concise and only modify the code needed to demonstrate the `einops.rearrange` usage.
