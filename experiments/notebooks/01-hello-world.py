# # Hello World: your first metta-ai experiment
#
# Welcome to your first reinforcement learning experiment in the metta-ai project. This notebook will guide you through creating, observing, evaluating, and training AI agents in a simple gridworld environment.
#
# ## What You'll Learn
#
# By the end of this notebook, you'll be able to:
# - Create and understand ASCII maps
# - Choose and observe different agent policies
# - Evaluate agent performance quantitatively
# - Train a new agent from scratch
# - Compare the performance of two agents
#
# ## 1. Setup
#
# Let's load dependencies and set up some scaffolding. Don't worry about the details here.

# ## 2. Defining an Environment
#
# In Metta AI, an **environment** is the virtual world where our agents act and learn. It has 2 main elements:
#
#   1. A Map -- the physical layout of the environment where agents can move and what objects they encounter. One simple way to define a map is to use a simple ASCII string. This much ASCII will get us started:
#       - `#` = walls that block movement
#       - `@` = where the agent starts
#       - `.` = empty spaces where agents can walk
#       - `m` = a mine that generates collectible ore
#   2. Game Rules -- what actions are available and how rewards are calculated. We express these rules through environment configuration.
#
# For now, we'll mostly rely on the default set of game rules, as follows:
#
# **Agents Can Observe:**
# - **Vision**: Agents see an 11x11 grid around themselves
# - **Awareness**: Agents know what resources they're carrying
# - **Feedback**: Agents receive information about their last action's success

# **Agents Can Act:**
# - Navigate in 8 directions (cardinal + diagonal) and rotate
# - Pick up & carry resources from objects like mines, or drop items
# - Interact with other agents -- we'll ignore this for now and just start with a single agent
#
# **Agents Encounter Objects:**
# - **Walls**: Block movement and create boundaries
# - **Mines**: Automatically generate ore over time
# - **Ore**: Collectible resources that agents can carry and trade for rewards
# - **Rewards**: Collecting ore gives small positive rewards that can be used to reinforce behavior
#
# In our environment, we'll also need an agent (sometimes referred to as a "policy") who can take action.
# We'll try out a very simple "opportunistic" agent that moves randomly around the environment. If it encounters
# a resource, it will usually (but not always) pick it up.
#
# In the following cell we'll lay out the map in ASCII, configure the environment to use it, and choose the opportunistic agent. We'll also set:
# - How many steps to run the simulation for
# - How long to sleep between steps
# - Some other basic parameters

# ## 3. Observing a Simulation
#
#  Now we'll actually run the simulation, using a "game loop" approach, where we:
# - Find out what action the agent wants to take
# - Step the environment forward one tick, taking the action into account
# - Render the environment to the screen (as an ASCII string)
# - Sleep for a bit
#
# We'll also track the agent's inventory and display the score.

    header.value = f"<b>Step:</b> {step+1}/{cfg.renderer_job.num_steps} | <b>Inventory:</b> {inv}"

# ### What You'll See:
# - The agent (`0`) moving back and forth randomly in the hallway
# - The mine ('m') is continually generating ore (not shown)
# - When the agent reaches the mine, it should sometimes pick up ore
# - This will increase the agent's "score"
#
#
# ## 4. Doing an Evaluation
#
# We've informally observed our agent doing its thing, but now let's formally evaluate its performance.
#
# **Evaluation** is the process of measuring how well an agent performs on a specific task.
#
# For our ore collection task, we'll configure the environment to track ore collection and provide appropriate rewards.

# ## 5. Deciding on Metrics
#
# Now that we have our evaluation environment, we need to decide **what to measure**.
#
# **Evaluation metrics** are the numbers that tell us how well our agent performs. Choosing the right metrics is crucial because they determine what we consider "success."
#
# ### What Should We Measure?
#
# For our ore collection task, we want to measure:
#
# **Ore Collection**: How much ore does the agent collect per episode?
#
# This is a simple, direct metric that tests the agent's ability to:
# - Navigate to the mine at the end of the hallway
# - Use the `get_items` action to collect ore
# - Return to the mine repeatedly to collect more ore
#
# ### Why This Metric Matters
#
# - **Simple**: Easy to understand and measure
# - **Direct**: Directly tests the agent's core task
# - **Scalable**: Trained agents should collect significantly more ore
# - **Realistic**: Tests both navigation and resource collection skills
#
# ### What We Expect from the Simple Agent
#
# Since the simple agent moves randomly and only has a 10% chance to try pickup actions:
# - **Low ore collection** (maybe 0.5-2.0 ore per episode) due to random movement and infrequent collection attempts
# - **Inefficient**: Will often wander away from the mine after collecting
# - **Inconsistent**: Some episodes will get lucky, others will get none
#
# This will give us a baseline to compare against when we later train an agent.

# %%
# Define our evaluation metric
evaluation_metric = {
    "ore_collection": {
        "description": "Average ore collected per episode",
        "calculation": "total_ore_collected / total_episodes",
        "expected_simple": "0.5-2.0 ore per episode"
    }
}

# %% [markdown]
# ## 6. Creating a Simulation Suite
#
# Now that we have our evaluation environment and metrics defined, we need to create a **simulation suite**.
#
# **Simulation suites** are collections of evaluation environments that sim.py uses to test agents. They define:
# - Which environments to test in
# - How many episodes to run per environment
# - What metrics to collect
#
# For our ore collection task, we'll create a custom simulation suite that uses our hallway environment.

# %%
# Create a custom simulation suite for our hallway ore collection task
hallway_simulation_suite = {
    "name": "hallway_ore_collection",
    "simulations": {
        "hallway/ore_collection": {
            "env": hallway_eval_config,  # Use the config directly
            "num_episodes": 100  # Run 100 episodes for good statistics
        }
    }
}

    yaml.dump(hallway_simulation_suite, f, default_flow_style=False, indent=2)
    sim_suite_path = f.name


# %% [markdown]
# ## 7. Running the Evaluation
#
# Now let's run our evaluation. We'll use `sim.py` to test the simple agent in our ore collection environment and see how it performs.
#
# **What we're doing:**
# - Running the simple agent through multiple episodes
# - Collecting data on ore collection performance
# - Visualizing the results to understand baseline performance
#
# This will give us a baseline to compare against when we later train an agent.

# ## 8. Training a New Agent
#
# **Training** is the process of teaching an agent to improve its behavior through trial and error. The agent
# starts with random behavior, receives feedback based on the game and reward rules we established in our environment,
# and hopefully, it gradually learns which actions lead to better outcomes.
#
# So far we've been observing an agent which was not trained at all; the opportunistic agent has baked-in behavior.
# Let's try now to train an agent which gets better scores than the opportunistic agent. To begin with, we make
# a training configuration. Key decisions to make here are:
# - What is the environment? -- we'll use the same hallway environment as before
# - What is the training algorithm? -- we'll use a simple "PPO" algorithm
# - What is the training duration? -- we'll use a short duration for now
