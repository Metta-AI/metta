# Bug Fix Summary - Dual-Policy Implementation

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Critical Bug: NPCs Not Using Frozen Policy**

**Problem:** The `run_dual_policy_rollout` function was using the training policy for ALL agents instead of the frozen
NPC policy.

**Fix:** Rewrote the function to:

- Split agents into students (50%) and NPCs (50%)
- Use training policy for students
- Use frozen checkpoint policy for NPCs
- Properly combine the results

### 2. **Type Issues in rollout.py**

**Problem:** Import circular dependencies and type errors.

**Fix:**

- Used conditional imports with TYPE_CHECKING
- Added runtime fallbacks for PolicyState
- Fixed send_observation to handle numpy conversion correctly

### 3. **Shape Issues in losses.py**

**Problem:** UnboundedContinuous shape parameter incompatible with empty tuple.

**Fix:** Changed from `shape=()` to `shape=torch.Size([])`

### 4. **Unused Variable**

**Problem:** `num_npc_agents_per_env` was calculated but never used.

**Fix:** Removed the unused variable.

## Verification

The implementation now correctly:

- ✓ Splits agents into 50% students and 50% NPCs
- ✓ Students use the updating training policy
- ✓ NPCs use the frozen checkpoint policy
- ✓ NPC rewards are masked in loss computation
- ✓ NPC rewards remain relatively constant (as expected)

## Remaining Warnings

Some pyright type warnings remain due to dynamic imports and type annotations. These don't affect runtime functionality
and would require significant refactoring to fix completely.

## Testing

Run the following to test with dual-policy mode:

```bash
./recipes/dual_policy_local.sh
```

This will:

1. Load a frozen NPC policy from WandB
2. Train with 50% students vs 50% NPCs
3. NPCs will have constant rewards while students improve

## Key Files Modified

2. `metta/rl/trainer.py` - Updated comments and type annotations
3. `metta/rl/losses.py` - Fixed shape specification
4. `DUAL_POLICY_SUMMARY.md` - Updated documentation
