# Task: Post-Dehydration Performance Regression Analysis

## Problem Statement
After removing Hydra and YAML configuration system from the Metta codebase, training performance has regressed significantly. Models are achieving worse final heart.get metrics compared to the pre-dehydration baseline (commit 724cde8fc27f8a30cd9c06eba38aa7cbda8c1515). Training is also less stable and slower.

## MVP Approach
Systematically audit each major subsystem to identify configuration differences, implementation changes, or behavioral regressions that could explain the performance degradation. Compare current implementation against the reference commit to pinpoint exact differences.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Documentation
1. Create comprehensive diagnostic framework document
2. Clone reference repository at commit 724cde8fc27f8a30cd9c06eba38aa7cbda8c1515 to /tmp/metta-reference
3. Establish systematic comparison methodology

### Phase 2: Subsystem Auditing
For each subsystem, identify 1-3 initial hypotheses, then add 1-3 runtime hypotheses as we investigate:

#### Core Subsystems to Audit:
1. **Agents** - Architecture, layer sizes, connectivity, non-linearities
2. **Trainer** - Calculations, hyperparameters, learning rates, batch processing
3. **Logging** - Metrics collection, averaging, statistical computation
4. **Checkpointing/Models** - State restoration, optimizer persistence, model loading
5. **Environment** - Configuration resolution, environment wrapping
6. **Curriculum** - Map sampling, difficulty progression, environment wrapping

#### Extended Subsystems (10+ total):
7. **Optimizer Configuration** - Learning rates, Adam parameters, scheduler behavior
8. **Batch Processing** - Batch sizes, gradient accumulation, data loading
9. **Network Initialization** - Weight initialization schemes, layer initialization
10. **Loss Functions** - Value loss, policy loss, entropy regularization
11. **Action/Observation Spaces** - Space definitions, preprocessing, normalization
12. **Reward Processing** - Reward scaling, normalization, clipping
13. **Memory Management** - Buffer sizes, experience replay, memory allocation
14. **Random Seeding** - Determinism, reproducibility, random number generation
15. **Configuration Resolution** - Default value propagation, override hierarchy

### Phase 3: Systematic Investigation
For each subsystem, execute:
1. Generate configuration diffs between old/new systems
2. Compare key implementation files
3. Test specific hypotheses with targeted experiments
4. Document findings and update hypotheses

## Implementation Updates

### Executive Summary of Findings

After systematic investigation of all major subsystems, I've identified **two primary suspects** for the performance regression:

## 🔥 **CRITICAL ISSUE #1: Missing Hyperparameter Scheduling**

**Impact**: HIGH - Directly affects final model performance
**Location**: `TrainerConfig` in `/metta/rl/trainer_config.py`

**Issue**: The reference system had active hyperparameter scheduling that's completely absent in current system:
- **Learning Rate**: Cosine decay from 0.000457 → 0.00003  
- **Entropy Coefficient**: Linear decay from 0.0021 → 0.0
- **PPO Clip**: Logarithmic decay from 0.1 → 0.05
- **Value Clip**: Linear decay from 0.1 → 0.05

**Current State**: All scheduler fields are `None` by default in `HyperparameterSchedulerConfig`

**Fix Required**: Add default scheduling to `TrainerConfig` that matches reference trainer.yaml

## 🔥 **CRITICAL ISSUE #2: Configuration Type Incompatibility** 

**Impact**: HIGH - Could prevent proper checkpoint loading/restoration
**Location**: Checkpoint loading system

**Issue**: Type signature mismatch between systems:
- **Reference**: `agent_cfg: DictConfig` (OmegaConf)
- **Current**: `agent_cfg: AgentConfig` (Pydantic)

**Risk**: Checkpoints saved with old DictConfig format may not load properly with new AgentConfig system, causing:
- Training restarts instead of continuations
- Model architecture mismatches
- Parameter initialization differences

**Fix Required**: Add backward compatibility for DictConfig checkpoints

## ⚠️ **Secondary Issues**

### Logging System Changes (Medium Impact)
- Stats accumulation robustness reduced 
- Environment stats key processing simplified
- Dual-policy infrastructure completely removed

### Checkpoint Selection Logic (Low Impact)
- Changed from filesystem order to sorted descending order
- Should select newest checkpoint correctly, but behavior changed

## ✅ **Systems Verified as Correct**

- **Agent Architecture**: Identical network topology and layer sizes
- **Environment Configuration**: Maps, rewards, and actions match exactly
- **Core PPO Parameters**: All hyperparameters match reference values
- **Curriculum**: Simple environment wrapper, no complex progression

## **Recommended Investigation Priority**

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Test hyperparameter scheduling restoration
   - Add default schedules to `TrainerConfig` matching reference
   - Run comparative training to verify performance recovery

2. **HIGH**: Verify checkpoint compatibility  
   - Test loading reference checkpoints with current system
   - Add migration support for DictConfig → AgentConfig

3. **MEDIUM**: Validate stats collection robustness
   - Monitor for any type errors during training
   - Compare metric collection patterns

## **Expected Impact**

The missing hyperparameter scheduling is the most likely primary cause of performance regression. Without learning rate decay and entropy annealing, the model:
- Cannot achieve fine-grained convergence in final training phases
- Maintains high exploration throughout training (no entropy decay)
- May get stuck in suboptimal local minima

The checkpoint compatibility issue could compound this by preventing proper training continuation, forcing restarts that lose learned progress.
