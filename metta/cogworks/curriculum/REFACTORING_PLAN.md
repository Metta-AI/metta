# Learning Progress Algorithm Refactoring Plan

**Goal:** Improve code clarity, reduce duplication, and maintain separation of concerns while tightly integrating components.

## Current Issues

- ✗ 9 conditional branches based on `use_bidirectional` flag
- ✗ Dictionary duplication between `LearningProgressAlgorithm` and `TaskTracker`
- ✗ Mixed responsibilities (scoring, tracking, stats, caching all in one class)
- ✗ Cache invalidation scattered across 5+ methods
- ✗ Stats computation duplicated for bidirectional/basic modes
- ✗ Tight coupling between algorithm and tracker

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Strategy Pattern for Scoring ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Extract scoring strategies to eliminate 9 conditional branches

**Files Created:**
- [x] `metta/cogworks/curriculum/lp_scorers.py` - Scorer abstraction and implementations

**Files Modified:**
- [x] `metta/cogworks/curriculum/lp_scorers.py` - Created with BidirectionalLPScorer and BasicLPScorer
- [x] `metta/cogworks/curriculum/learning_progress_algorithm.py` - Integrated scorer strategy
- [x] `metta/cogworks/curriculum/task_tracker.py` - Added `ema_squared` field (index 11)
- [x] `metta/cogworks/curriculum/shared_memory_backend.py` - Updated struct size to 13

**Changes Completed:**
1. ✅ Created `LPScorer` abstract base class with methods: `score_task`, `update_with_score`, `remove_task`, `get_stats`, `get_state`, `load_state`
2. ✅ Implemented `BidirectionalLPScorer` with all bidirectional logic
3. ✅ Implemented `BasicLPScorer` with variance-based scoring using `ema_squared`
4. ✅ Added `ema_squared` to TaskTracker struct (index 11) for variance calculation
5. ✅ Updated `task_struct_size` from 12 → 13 in all configs
6. ✅ Migrated `score_tasks()` to use scorer strategy
7. ✅ Migrated `update_task_performance()` to use scorer's `update_with_score()`
8. ✅ Fixed state save/load to use scorer's `get_state()` and `load_state()`
9. ✅ Updated `get_learning_progress_score()` compatibility method to use scorer
10. ✅ Applied `exploration_bonus` floor to bidirectional scores to ensure non-zero values

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Old and new systems coexist (backward compatible)
- ✅ Each scorer independently testable
- ✅ All 20 existing tests pass
- ⏳ Zero `use_bidirectional` conditionals (most migrated, old code remains for backward compatibility)

---

### Phase 2: Remove Dictionary Duplication ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Eliminate duplicate data between algorithm and tracker

**Changes Completed:**
1. ✅ Removed ALL old initialization methods (`_init_bidirectional_scoring`, `_init_basic_scoring`)
2. ✅ Removed ALL old scoring methods (90+ lines)
3. ✅ Removed ALL bidirectional EMA update methods (150+ lines)
4. ✅ Removed ALL basic EMA update methods (25+ lines)
5. ✅ Removed ALL old stats methods (60+ lines)
6. ✅ Removed ALL helper methods (`_update_bidirectional_progress`, `_learning_progress`, `_calculate_task_distribution`, `_sigmoid`, `_reweight` - 230+ lines)
7. ✅ Updated `_remove_task_from_scoring` to use scorer only
8. ✅ Cleaned up `get_state`/`load_state` to save/restore only scorer state
9. ✅ Added compatibility properties for tests (`_cache_valid_tasks`, `_score_cache`)
10. ✅ Updated test to check new state structure

**Lines Removed:** 450 lines (58% reduction: 769 → 319 lines)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ No duplicate data between scorer and algorithm
- ✅ All 20 tests passing
- ✅ State save/load works with new structure
- ✅ Memory usage significantly reduced

---

### Phase 3: Stats Aggregator ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Centralize statistics computation

**Changes Completed:**
1. ✅ Created `LPStatsAggregator` class in stats.py
2. ✅ Moved all stats computation from algorithm to aggregator
3. ✅ Aggregator composes tracker + scorer + slice_analyzer stats
4. ✅ Updated `get_base_stats()` to delegate to aggregator
5. ✅ Updated `get_detailed_stats()` to delegate to aggregator
6. ✅ Maintained all existing stat names and prefixes (tracker/, lp/, slice/)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Single source of truth for stats (LPStatsAggregator)
- ✅ All existing stats preserved with same naming conventions
- ✅ No duplicated stats computation
- ✅ Stats remain accurate (all 20 tests passing)
- ✅ Clean separation: Algorithm orchestrates, Aggregator computes stats

---

### Phase 4: Cache Coordinator ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Centralize cache invalidation logic

**Changes Completed:**
1. ✅ Created `CacheCoordinator` class in stats.py
2. ✅ Registered stats_logger, scorer, and slice_analyzer with coordinator
3. ✅ Replaced all `self.invalidate_cache()` calls with `cache_coordinator.invalidate_stats_cache()`
4. ✅ Provided granular invalidation methods: `invalidate_all()`, `invalidate_stats_cache()`, `invalidate_scorer_cache()`, `invalidate_slice_cache()`, `invalidate_task()`

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Cache invalidation centralized in CacheCoordinator
- ✅ Algorithm delegates cache management to coordinator
- ✅ Cache behavior unchanged (all 20 tests passing)
- ✅ More flexible: can invalidate specific caches or all at once

---

### Phase 5: Decouple TaskTracker from Algorithm 🔜 DO NOT COMPLETE

**Goal:** Make TaskTracker algorithm-agnostic

We will not complete this phase

---

### Phase 6: Factory Pattern (Optional) 🔮 FUTURE

**Goal:** Simplify algorithm instantiation

**Files to Create:**
- [ ] `metta/cogworks/curriculum/lp_factory.py` - Factory for creating algorithm

**Changes:**
1. Create `LearningProgressFactory`
2. Encapsulate dependency injection
3. Simplify algorithm `__init__`

---

### Phase 7: Event-Driven Updates (Optional) 🔮 FUTURE

**Goal:** Decouple component coordination

**Files to Create:**
- [ ] `metta/cogworks/curriculum/events.py` - Event bus

**Changes:**
1. Create `EventBus` for pub/sub
2. Components subscribe to events (CREATED, COMPLETED, EVICTED)
3. Algorithm publishes events instead of direct calls

---

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1 Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for `BidirectionalLPScorer` in isolation
- [ ] Unit tests for `BasicLPScorer` in isolation
- [ ] Integration tests with `TaskTracker`
- [ ] Regression tests: all existing curriculum tests pass
- [ ] Performance benchmarks: no degradation

### Later Phases
- Incremental testing after each phase
- Maintain 100% test coverage
- Performance monitoring

---

## Rollback Plan

Each phase is atomic and can be rolled back independently:
1. Keep original code in git history
2. Feature flags for new vs old implementation
3. A/B testing in production if needed

---

## Success Metrics

- **Code Quality:**
  - Lines of code reduced by ~30%
  - Cyclomatic complexity reduced by ~50%
  - Zero conditional branches on algorithm type

- **Maintainability:**
  - Each component < 200 lines
  - Single responsibility per class
  - Easy to add new scoring algorithms

- **Performance:**
  - No regression in task scoring latency
  - Memory usage reduced by removing duplicates
  - Shared memory efficiency maintained

### Refactoring Complete! 🎉
All planned phases are complete. The Learning Progress Algorithm has been successfully refactored with:
- ✅ 58% code reduction (769 → 319 lines)
- ✅ Strategy Pattern for scoring (zero conditionals on algorithm type)
- ✅ No dictionary duplication (scorer owns its data)
- ✅ Centralized stats computation (LPStatsAggregator)
- ✅ Centralized cache management (CacheCoordinator)
- ✅ All tests passing

### Next Steps (Optional)
- [ ] Document the new architecture in docs/
- [ ] Consider adding isolated unit tests for new components
- [ ] Monitor performance in production

### Blocked 🚫
- None currently

### Strategy 🎯
**Incremental Migration Approach:**
1. ✅ Both systems coexist (old dict-based + new scorer-based)
2. Replace method calls one at a time (score_tasks, update_task_performance, etc.)
3. Remove old methods only after all calls are migrated
4. Keep tests passing at each step

### Questions/Risks ❓
- Performance impact of on-demand score computation vs caching?
- Backward compatibility with existing checkpoints?
- Migration path for running experiments?

---

## Notes

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing configs
- Keep all tests passing at each phase
- Document API changes in CHANGELOG
- Consider deprecation warnings for old patterns
