# Multiprocessing vectorization configuration for CPU training
#
# This setup uses 4 cores on a Mac to achieve higher SPS (Steps Per Second)
# compared to single-worker mac_serial configuration.
#
# The multiprocessing approach parallelizes environment simulation across workers,
# which is different from GPU parallelization.
