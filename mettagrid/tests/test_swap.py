def test_swap():
    """Test that swap_objects preserves the original layers when swapping positions.

    This test verifies the fix for a critical bug where swap_objects was swapping
    the layers along with the positions, causing agents to end up in the wrong layer.

    The bug would cause:
    - Agents (which must be in AgentLayer=0) to move to ObjectLayer=1
    - Objects to move to AgentLayer=0

    This violates the invariant that agents must always remain in AgentLayer.
