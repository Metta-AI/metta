# Example configuration showing how to use cardinal movement

game:
  actions:
    # Traditional tank-style movement (forward/backward + rotation)
    move:
      enabled: false  # Disable for pure cardinal movement
    rotate:
      enabled: false  # Disable for pure cardinal movement
    
    # New cardinal movement action (direct NSEW movement)
    move_cardinal:
      enabled: true
    
    # Other actions remain unchanged
    noop:
      enabled: true
    put_items:

    get_items:
      enabled: true

# Example configurations:

# 1. Pure cardinal movement (recommended for new environments):
#    - move: false
#    - rotate: false
#    - move_cardinal: true

# 2. Pure tank-style movement (backward compatible):
#    - move: true
#    - rotate: true
#    - move_cardinal: false

# 3. Hybrid mode (both movement types available):
#    - move: true
#    - rotate: true
#    - move_cardinal: true
#    Note: This gives agents more action choices and may affect learning

# Agent orientation behavior:
# - In cardinal mode, agents automatically face the direction they move
# - Orientation still affects directional actions like attack
# - Agents can "look at" walls by attempting to move into them
