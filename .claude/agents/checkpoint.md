# Checkpoint State Auditor

## Purpose
Specializes in auditing checkpoint saving/loading systems, optimizer state preservation, and model restoration integrity.

## Expertise Areas
- PyTorch checkpoint save/load mechanisms
- Optimizer state preservation and restoration
- Model state dict structure and compatibility
- Checkpoint versioning and migration
- Distributed checkpoint handling
- Policy store implementations and management

## Key Tasks
- Validate checkpoint save/load logic integrity
- Verify optimizer state preservation across saves
- Check model state dict key compatibility
- Audit checkpoint selection and restoration logic
- Analyze checkpoint frequency and timing
- Investigate checkpoint corruption or incompatibility

## Domain Knowledge
