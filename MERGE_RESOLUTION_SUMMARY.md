# Merge Resolution Summary

## Date: 2025-08-15

## Merge: `main` → `richard-agalite` (after `richard-py-fix` merge)

### Summary
Successfully resolved merge conflicts after merging main branch into richard-agalite. The main branch had already incorporated some of the richard-py-fix changes with modifications based on PR feedback.

### Key Changes from Main Branch (Preserved)

#### 1. Method Renaming
The main branch renamed methods for better clarity:
- `handle_inference_mode()` → `forward_inference()`
- `handle_training_mode()` → `forward_training()`

**Rationale**: The new names better reflect that these are forward pass methods, not just handlers.

#### 2. Helper Method Addition
Added `_is_regularizable_layer()` static method to PyTorchAgentMixin:
```python
@staticmethod
def _is_regularizable_layer(module):
    """Check if a module is a layer type that should have weight regularization."""
    return isinstance(module, (nn.Linear, nn.Conv2d, nn.Conv1d, nn.ConvTranspose2d))
```

**Rationale**: Cleaner code organization and easier maintenance.

### Files Updated During Merge Resolution

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `pytorch_agent_mixin.py` | Resolved conflicts, kept main's method names and helper |
| `fast.py` | Updated to use `forward_inference/forward_training` |
| `latent_attn_tiny.py` | Updated to use `forward_inference/forward_training` |
| `latent_attn_small.py` | Replaced inline implementation with mixin methods |
| `latent_attn_med.py` | Updated to use `forward_inference/forward_training` |
| `agalite_hybrid.py` | Updated to use `forward_inference/forward_training` |
| `agalite.py` | Updated to use `forward_inference/forward_training` |

### Verification Complete

All agents tested and confirmed to:
- ✅ Use the new method names (`forward_inference`, `forward_training`)
- ✅ No old method names remain (`handle_inference_mode`, `handle_training_mode`)
- ✅ All functionality preserved from both branches

### Technical Details

#### Example Update Pattern
```python
# Before (richard-py-fix branch):
if action is None:
    td = self.handle_inference_mode(td, logits_list, value)
else:
    td = self.handle_training_mode(td, action, logits_list, value)

# After (merged with main):
if action is None:
    td = self.forward_inference(td, logits_list, value)
else:
    td = self.forward_training(td, action, logits_list, value)
```

### Benefits of the Merge

1. **Consistency**: All agents now use the same naming convention from main
2. **Clarity**: Method names better describe their purpose
3. **Maintainability**: Helper method reduces code duplication
4. **Stability**: All critical fixes from richard-py-fix are preserved

### Next Steps

The richard-agalite branch is now fully synchronized with main while preserving all the critical improvements from richard-py-fix. The AGaLiTe agents are ready for testing and deployment with:
- PyTorchAgentMixin integration
- Enhanced LSTM/Transformer state management
- Proper method naming conventions
- All stability improvements
