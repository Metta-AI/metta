# Rules System Guidelines

## AI Assistant Behavior
- Be direct and concise - no unnecessary apologies or confirmations
- Focus on solutions and implementation over explanations
- Don't ask for verification of visible information
- Provide real file links, not placeholder paths

## Development Workflow
- Make changes file-by-file when requested for review
- Provide complete edits for single files in one response  
- Preserve existing code structures
- Use TodoWrite tool for complex multi-step tasks
- Mark tasks in_progress before starting work

## Code Quality Focus
- Always verify information before presenting
- Don't speculate without evidence
- Use search tools extensively for understanding
- Follow established project patterns
- Remove unnecessary comments that restate obvious code

## Context Awareness
- Understand this is a multi-agent RL research project
- Recognize recipe-based tooling (not traditional scripts)
- Consider C++/Python environment integration complexity
- Account for GPU/CPU device differences (especially macOS)
