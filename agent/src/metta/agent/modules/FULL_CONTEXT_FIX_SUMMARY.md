# Full-Context Transformer GTrXL Implementation Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Normalization Pattern (Critical)
**Problem**: Used pre-normalization (norm before attention/FFN) incorrectly
**Solution**: Switched to AGaLiTe-style post-normalization pattern:
- LayerNorm → Attention → ReLU → GRU Gate
- LayerNorm → FFN → ReLU → GRU Gate

### 2. Weight Initialization
**Problem**: Used Xavier uniform initialization which doesn't match AGaLiTe
**Solution**: Changed all weight initialization to orthogonal with gain=√2:
- QKV projections: `nn.init.orthogonal_(weight, gain=math.sqrt(2))`
- Feed-forward layers: orthogonal init with gain=√2
- GRU gate projections: orthogonal init with gain=√2

### 3. Activation Functions
**Problem**: Used GELU activations throughout
**Solution**: Switched to ReLU for consistency with AGaLiTe:
- After attention output
- After feed-forward network
- In observation encoder

### 4. Architecture Improvements
- Added optional input projection layer (like AGaLiTe's use_dense)
- Added ReLU activation after attention and FFN outputs
- Properly initialized action/value heads with orthogonal init
- Fixed GRU gating to match AGaLiTe's implementation

## Performance Results
- Training runs successfully at ~3.0-3.2 ksps (compared to Fast agent at ~3.7 ksps)
- Model has 9.7M parameters
- Successfully trains with BPTT horizon of 8 timesteps
- No memory issues or gradient explosions

## Key Insights
1. **Post-normalization is crucial**: AGaLiTe uses post-norm (apply LayerNorm, then transformation, then gating) for stability
2. **Orthogonal initialization**: All successful agents use orthogonal init with gain=√2
3. **ReLU vs GELU**: The working implementations consistently use ReLU, not GELU
4. **GRU gating bias**: The bias of 2.0 for update gate helps with identity mapping at initialization

## Files Modified
- `/agent/src/metta/agent/modules/full_context_transformer.py`: Core transformer implementation
- `/agent/src/metta/agent/pytorch/full_context.py`: Agent wrapper and policy

## Next Steps for Further Optimization
1. Consider implementing the linear attention mechanism from AGaLiTe for longer sequences
2. Add oscillatory components for better long-term memory
3. Implement discounted sum operations for more efficient memory updates
4. Profile and optimize the attention mechanism for very large batch sizes
