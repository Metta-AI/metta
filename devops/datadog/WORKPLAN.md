# Datadog Observability System - Work Plan

**Current Status**: Production deployment with 7 collectors, 8 dashboards (all using Jsonnet), and 130+ metrics

**Branch**: `robb/1022-datadog` **PR**: [#3384](https://github.com/Metta-AI/metta/pull/3384)

**Dashboard Framework**: Comprehensive Jsonnet library with layouts, presets, and 7 component libraries (2,550+ lines of documentation)

**‚úÖ All Dashboards Migrated**: Every collector now has a Jsonnet-based dashboard with component libraries

**‚ö†Ô∏è Active Issue**: Health FoM collector causing CronJob crashes - see `ISSUE-health-fom-failures.md` for details

---

## ‚úÖ What's Deployed and Working

### üîå Seven Collectors (137+ metrics)

Running in production via unified CronJob (every 15 minutes):

1. **GitHub Collector** (28 metrics) - PRs, commits, CI/CD, code changes, developers
2. **Skypilot Collector** (30 metrics) - Job status, runtime, GPU utilization, regional distribution
3. **Asana Collector** (14 metrics) - Tasks, velocity, cycle time, bugs workflow
4. **EC2 Collector** (19 metrics) - Instances, EBS volumes, snapshots, cost estimates
5. **WandB Collector** (20 metrics) - Training runs (24h), push-to-main CI tracking (5 SPS metrics), sweep metrics, GPU hours
6. **Kubernetes Collector** (15 metrics) - Pods, deployments, node health, resource waste
7. **Health FoM Collector** (14 metrics) - CI/CD and Training health scores (0.0-1.0 scale) ‚ö†Ô∏è **Currently disabled due to crashes**

### üìä Dashboard Status

**‚úÖ Production Collector Dashboards** (8 dashboards):
- `github_cicd.jsonnet` ‚Üí GitHub CI/CD metrics (ID: 7gy-9ub-2sq)
- `skypilot_jobs.jsonnet` ‚Üí Skypilot job tracking (ID: mtw-y2p-4ed)
- `ec2.jsonnet` ‚Üí AWS EC2 infrastructure (ID: 4ue-n4w-b7a)
- `asana.jsonnet` ‚Üí Project management (ID: srz-bhk-zr2)
- `policy_evaluator.jsonnet` ‚Üí APM evaluation metrics (ID: gpk-2y2-9er)

- `system_health_rollup_wildcard.json` ‚Üí Vega-Lite heatmap via `generate_wildcard_fom_grid.py`


### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure

- **Helm Chart**: `devops/charts/dashboard-cronjob/` - Unified CronJob deployment
- **Security**: All credentials in AWS Secrets Manager with IRSA
- **Management**: CLI via `metta datadog` + Python scripts in `devops/datadog/scripts/`
- **Documentation**: Full guides in `devops/datadog/docs/`

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

- [ ] **Fix health_fom collector crashes** - See `ISSUE-health-fom-failures.md`
  - Likely OOM or Datadog API timeout when querying historical metrics
  - Workaround: Temporarily disabled in production
  - Options: Increase memory, optimize queries, or run in separate job
- [ ] Address PR feedback and merge to main
- [ ] Monitor production stability (95%+ collector success rate for active collectors)

### Dashboard Migration - ‚úÖ Complete!

All collector dashboards have been successfully migrated to the Jsonnet framework:
- ‚úÖ Migrated `policy_evaluator` from legacy JSON to Jsonnet
- ‚úÖ Created `kubernetes` dashboard with 15 metrics across 3 sections
- ‚úÖ Created `wandb` dashboard with 10 metrics for ML training tracking

**Component Libraries Created**:
- `components/kubernetes.libsonnet` - 18 widget functions for cluster health
- `components/wandb.libsonnet` - 14 widget functions for ML training (now includes push-to-main CI and sweep metrics)

### Near-term (When Needed)

Ideas for future work - prioritize based on actual needs:

#### High Priority: Dashboard Query Verification

**Problem**: Currently can generate and deploy dashboards but cannot verify queries return data without manually checking Datadog UI.

**Solution**: Simple script to verify all dashboard queries return data using Datadog Metrics Query API.

**What it does**:
- Parse dashboard JSON and extract metric queries
- Call `/api/v1/query` for each query
- Report which queries have data and which don't
- Simple text output: "‚úì query works" or "‚úó no data"

**What it doesn't do**:
- Screenshots or visual verification (not needed - visual issues are rare)
- Complex analysis or AI (overkill for this use case)

**Benefits**:
- Close feedback loop for Claude Code: know immediately if queries work
- Catch 90% of issues (queries with no data)
- Fast (<10 seconds) and simple (single script)

**Status**: Research complete, ready to implement

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours total

See `ISSUES-datadog-access.md` for detailed research and implementation plan.

#### Lower Priority Items

- **Alerting**: Set up critical alerts (CI failures, collector failures, cost spikes)
- **Dashboard improvements**: Add SLO markers, template variables, conditional formatting
- **Multi-environment**: Separate staging/production metrics with environment tags
- **New collectors**: Add based on team needs (evaluate quarterly)
