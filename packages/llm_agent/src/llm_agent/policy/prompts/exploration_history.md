=== EXPLORATION STRATEGY ===
CRITICAL: You need to explore FAR from origin to find extractors!
- If you see a wall, go AROUND it (try adjacent direction), don't reverse
- PERSIST in one general direction until you find extractors
- Extractors are usually 15-30 tiles away from spawn
- If you've been exploring and only see chest/assembler/charger, you're still too close to spawn
- DON'T backtrack to areas you've already explored - keep pushing outward
