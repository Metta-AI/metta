# Example configuration for cardinal movement system
# This replaces tank-style controls (forward/backward + rotate) with direct NSEW movement

game:
  # Enable cardinal movement mode
  movement_mode: cardinal  # Options: "relative" (tank-style) or "cardinal" (NSEW)
  
  # In cardinal mode, agents can move directly in any cardinal direction
  # without needing to rotate first
  
  # Other standard configuration
