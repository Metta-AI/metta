# This config shows the features of the mapgen system.
_target_: metta.map.mapgen.MapGen

# With mapgen, top-level width and height must be known in advance. We don't do layout based on children components.

# MapGen level is a tree of scenes, instantiated from scene classes.
# You can think of scenes as modules that are responsible for drawing or updating some part of the map.
# The term "scene" is borrowed from Godot.

# This is the root scene.
root:
  # Class of scene to instantiate.

  # Parameters to pass to the scene constructor.
  # This will draw 6 rooms in a 2x3 grid, all empty.
  params:
    rows: 2
    columns: 3

  # Most scenes can have children definitions.
  # Each child is created in the areas (slots) defined by the parent scene, so the specific areas are determined by the parent scene.
  #
  # You can think of the children config listed below as a list of SQL-like queries.
  # Each child on the list can match several areas and so it produce multiple scene instances.
  #
  # Children are applied in order, so you can also think of them as "paint" commands or layers.
  # Children that come later in the list will be rendered on top of the map that was rendered previously, and can erase or modify the map.
  children:
    - # First, let's turn two rooms into mazes.

      # Take only two areas; if not set, all matching areas are selected.
