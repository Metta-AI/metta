class LSTM(LayerBase):
    """
    LSTM layer that handles tensor reshaping and state management automatically.

    This class wraps a PyTorch LSTM with proper tensor shape handling, making it easier
    to integrate LSTMs into neural network policies without dealing with complex tensor
    manipulations. It handles reshaping inputs/outputs, manages hidden states, and ensures
    consistent tensor dimensions throughout the forward pass.

    The layer processes tensors of shape [B, TT, ...] or [B, ...], where:
    - B is the batch size
    - TT is an optional time dimension

    It reshapes inputs appropriately for the LSTM, processes them through the network,
    and reshapes outputs back to the expected format, while also managing the LSTM's
    hidden state.

    Note that the __init__ of any layer class and the MettaAgent are only called when the agent
    is instantiated and never again. I.e., not when it is reloaded from a saved policy.
