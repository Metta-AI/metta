"""Test module for negative action argument handling.

The tests that were previously here have been removed per code review feedback.
The resource_mod action ignores the arg parameter completely (it's AOE-based),
so testing negative args specifically for resource_mod was not meaningful.
"""

# This file is intentionally minimal.
# Previous tests were removed as they were not validating what they claimed.
