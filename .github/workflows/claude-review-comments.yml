        Review the PR diff and specifically look for unnecessary comments in the code.

        **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
        1. If you find NO unnecessary comments that should be removed:
           - Simply respond with "No issues found."
           - DO NOT create any review
        2. ONLY create a review if you find comments that genuinely need to be removed
        3. Focus on comments that add no value or actively harm code readability

        **Comments to flag for removal**:
        1. Comments that merely restate what the code is doing (e.g., "# increment counter" for "counter += 1")
        2. Comments explaining obvious operations that are clear from the code itself
        3. Outdated or incorrect comments that no longer match the implementation
        4. Comments that duplicate information already conveyed by descriptive variable/function names
        5. Comments stating obvious Git commands or simple technical operations

        **Comments to KEEP (do not flag these)**:
        - Comments explaining WHY something is done
        - Comments providing important context or warnings
        - TODO/FIXME comments (unless they're clearly obsolete)
        - Comments explaining complex algorithms or business logic
        - License headers or copyright notices
        - Comments that help with code navigation or structure

        **Examples**:
        - REMOVE: `# set git detachedHead config to false` before `git config advice.detachedHead false`
        - KEEP: `# Disable detached HEAD warnings to avoid confusing new contributors`
        - REMOVE: `# loop through users` before `for user in users:`
        - KEEP: `# Process users in reverse order to handle dependencies`

        Only create suggestions for comments that genuinely harm code readability or provide
        misleading information. If the comments are merely redundant but not harmful, or if
        you're unsure, err on the side of not creating a review.
