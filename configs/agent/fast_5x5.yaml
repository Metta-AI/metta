# see reference_design.yaml for explanation of components

# This is a CNN-based model that takes environment tokens and converts them into a box with channels, width, and
# height, and then passes it to a CNN encoder stack. It is not robust to changing observation features. For that,
# use the attention-based models.

# The difference between this and the standard "fast" agent is that this model has reduced to be compatible with 5x5 observations
