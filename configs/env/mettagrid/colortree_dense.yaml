# ColorTree with dense reward mode - immediate rewards for each correct action
defaults:
  - colortree_demo
  - _self_

game:
  actions:
    color_tree:
      reward_mode: "dense"  # Get immediate reward after each correct action
      # With dense mode and sequence_reward=5.0:
      # Each correct action gives 5.0/4 = 1.25 reward immediately
      # No need to wait for the full sequence to complete
      # This provides the fastest feedback for learning
