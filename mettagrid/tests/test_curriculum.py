"""
Test suite for curriculum learning algorithms.

This module tests specific scenarios to validate that curriculum algorithms
behave correctly under controlled conditions:

Progressive Curriculum Tests:
1. Monotonic linear signal -> should advance through tasks correctly
2. Always 0 signal -> should stay on first task
3. Random signal -> should still progress with right parameters

Learning Progress Tests:
4. Mixed impossible/learnable tasks -> should weight learnable evenly, ignore impossible
5. Threshold dependency -> should first weight primary, then secondary after milestone

Prioritize Regressed Curriculum Tests:
6. All tasks have linear scaling -> should maintain equal distribution
7. One impossible task (always 0) -> should get minimum weight as max_score = 0 ==> LP = epislon
