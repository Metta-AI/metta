# CoGames: Cogs vs Clips Multi-Agent RL Environment

CoGames is a collection of multi-agent cooperative and competitive environments designed for reinforcement learning
research.

## The game: Cogs vs Clips

Multiple "Cog" agents, controlled by user-provided policies, must cooperate to extract Hearts from the environment.
Doing so requires gathering resources, operating machinery, and assembling components. Many steps will require
interacting with a "station". Many such interactions will require multiple cogs working in tandem.

Your Cogs' efforts may be thwarted by Clips: NPC agents that disable stations or otherwise impede progress.

There are many mission configurations available, with different map sizes, resource and station layouts, and game rules.
Overall, Cogs vs Clips aims to present rich environments with:

- **Resource management**: Energy, materials (carbon, oxygen, germanium, silicon), and crafted components
- **Station-based interactions**: Different stations provide unique capabilities (extractors, assemblers, chargers,
  chests)
- **Sparse rewards**: Agents receive rewards only upon successfully crafting target items (hearts)
- **Partial observability**: Agents have limited visibility of the environment
- **Required multi-agent cooperation**: Agents must coordinate to efficiently use shared resources and stations

Cogs should refer to their [MISSION.md](MISSION.md) for a thorough description of the game mechanics.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
uv pip install cogames

# List missions
cogames missions

# Play an episode of the machina_1 game
cogames play training_facility_1 --interactive

# Train a policy in a simple, single-agent game
cogames train training_facility_1 --policy simple

# Watch or play along side your trained policy
cogames play training_facility_1 --interactive --policy simple --policy-data ./train_dir/policy.pt

# Evaluate your policy
cogames evaluate training_facility_1 simple:./train_dir/policy.pt
```

## Commands

### `cogames missions [mission_name]`

Lists all missions and their high-level specs.

If a `mission_name` is provided, it describe a specific mission in detail.

### `cogames play [mission]`

Play an episode of the specified mission. Cogs' actions are determined by the provided policy.

**Options:**

- `--policy PATH`: Policy class (default: random)
- `--policy-data PATH`: Path to weights file/dir
- `--steps N`: Number of steps (default: 1000)
- `--render MODE`: 'gui' or 'text' (default: gui)
- `--interactive`: Interactive mode (default: true)

`cogames play` supports a gui-based and text-based game renderer, both of which support many features to inspect agents
and manually play alongside them.

### `cogames train [mission]`

Train a policy on a mission.

**Options:**

- `--policy PATH`: Policy class (default: SimplePolicy)
- `--initial-weights PATH`: Starting weights
- `--checkpoints PATH`: Save location (default: ./train_dir)
- `--steps N`: Training steps (default: 10000)
- `--device STR`: 'auto', 'cpu', or 'cuda' (default: auto)
- `--batch-size N`: Batch size (default: 4096)
- `--num-workers N`: Worker processes (default: CPU count)

### Custom Policy Architectures

To get started, `cogames` supports some torch-nn-based policy architectures out of the box (such as SimplePolicy). To
supply your own, you will want to extend `cogames.policy.Policy`.

```python
from cogames.policy import Policy

class MyPolicy(Policy):
    def __init__(self, observation_space, action_space):
        self.network = MyNetwork(observation_space, action_space)

    def get_action(self, observation, agent_id=None):
        return self.network(observation)

    def reset(self):
        pass

    def save(self, path):
        torch.save(self.network.state_dict(), path)

    @classmethod
    def load(cls, path, env=None):
        policy = cls(env.observation_space, env.action_space)
        policy.network.load_state_dict(torch.load(path))
        return policy
```

To train with using your class, supply a path to it with the `--policy`argument, e.g.
`cogames train training_facility_1 --policy path.to.MyPolicy`.

#### Environment API

The underlying environment follows the Gymnasium API:

```python
from cogames.game import get_mission
from mettagrid.envs import MettaGridEnv

# Load a mission configuration
config, _, __ = game_module.get_mission("assembler_2_complex", "default")

# Create environment
env = MettaGridEnv(env_cfg=config)

# Reset environment
obs, info = env.reset()

# Game loop
for step in range(1000):
    # Your policy computes actions for all agents
    actions = policy.get_actions(obs)  # Dict[agent_id, action]

    # Step environment
    obs, rewards, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(actions)

    if terminated or truncated:
        obs, info = env.reset()
```

### `cogames evaluate [game] [policies...]`

Evaluate one or more policies.

**Policy spec format:** `{class_path}[:data_path][:proportion]`

**Examples:**

```bash
# Single policy
cogames evaluate machina_1 random

# Trained policy
cogames evaluate machina_1 simple:train_dir/model.pt

# Latest checkpoint in directory
cogames evaluate machina_1 simple:train_dir/

# Mixed population of agents, 3/8 of which steered by your policy, the rest by a random-action policy
cogames evaluate machina_1 simple:train_dir/model.pt:3 random::5
```

**Options:**

- `--episodes N`: Number of episodes (default: 10)
- `--action-timeout-ms N`: Timeout per action (default: 250ms)

When multiple policies are provided, `cogames evaluate` fixes the number of agents each policy will control, but
randomizes their assignments each episode.

### `cogames make-mission [base_mission]`

Create custom mission configuration.

**Options:**

- `--agents N`: Number of agents (default: 2)
- `--width W`: Map width (default: 10)
- `--height H`: Map height (default: 10)
- `--output PATH`: Save to file

You will be able to provide your specified `--output` path as the `mission` argument to other `cogames` commmands.

### `cogames version`

Show version info for mettagrid, pufferlib-core, and cogames.
