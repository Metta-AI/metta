    """Fetch metrics from wandb runs.

    Args:
        run_names: List of wandb run names to fetch metrics from
        samples: Number of samples to return. If None, fetches all data points without subsampling.
                Set to a large number (e.g., 10000) for more data without full scan.
                Default is 1000 for backwards compatibility.
        keys: Optional list of specific metric keys to fetch (speeds up fetching)
        min_step: Optional minimum step to fetch from (ONLY works when samples=None)
        max_step: Optional maximum step to fetch to (ONLY works when samples=None)

    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping run names to pandas DataFrames containing the metrics

    Note:
        min_step and max_step parameters ONLY work when samples=None.
        When using sampling (samples is a number), these parameters are ignored because
        wandb's history() method doesn't support step filtering - it returns evenly
        distributed samples across the entire run.

    Warning:
        Using samples=None with large runs can be VERY slow as scan_history()
        loads all data from wandb servers before returning. Consider using
        samples=10000 or samples=50000 for a good balance of data completeness
        and performance.
