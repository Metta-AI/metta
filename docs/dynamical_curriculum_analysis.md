# Dynamical Curriculum Analysis

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a rigorous curriculum learning study using a structured task environment with explicit learning dynamics defined by differential equations. This approach ensures that **all curricula (including the oracle) are compared on equal footing** using the same dynamical system.

## Motivation

The previous curriculum analysis used a fixed trajectory oracle that didn't actually simulate the dynamical system. This new approach addresses this limitation by:

1. **Implementing a proper dynamical system** with differential equations for learning dynamics
2. **Ensuring fair comparison** - all curricula use the same underlying system
3. **Providing rigorous evaluation** based on mathematical foundations
4. **Enabling parameter studies** to understand the impact of different learning dynamics

## Experimental Setup

### Task Structure

The dependencies between tasks are modeled as a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**. An edge from task `i` to task `j` signifies that task `i` is a prerequisite for task `j`.

```python
# Example: Sequential chain of 10 tasks
tasks = {
    "task_0": [],      # Root task
    "task_1": ["task_0"],  # Depends on task_0
    "task_2": ["task_1"],  # Depends on task_1
    # ... and so on
}
```

### Learning Dynamics

The performance on each task `i`, denoted as $P_i \in [0, 1]$, evolves according to the following differential equation:

$$\dot{P_i} = \left( S_i + \gamma \sum_{j \in \text{parents}(i)} S_j \right) \cdot \left( \prod_{c \in \text{children}(i)} P_c \right) \cdot (1 - P_i) - \lambda P_i$$

Where:
- **$S_i$**: Number of times task `i` is sampled for training in an epoch
- **$\gamma$**: Parameter controlling parent task contribution to child learning
- **$\prod_{c \in \text{children}(i)} P_c$**: Gating term - learning a prerequisite is only useful if dependent tasks are also being learned
- **$(1 - P_i)$**: Saturation term ensuring performance cannot exceed 1
- **$\lambda$**: Constant forgetting rate causing performance decay

### Numerical Integration

The differential equations are solved using **Euler integration**:

$$P_i(t + \Delta t) = P_i(t) + \Delta t \cdot \dot{P_i}(t)$$

With a time step of $\Delta t = 0.1$ epochs.

## Curriculum Strategies

### 1. Random Curriculum
- **Sampling**: Uniform probability $1/N$ for each task
- **Adaptation**: None - static throughout training
- **Baseline**: Provides a reference for random exploration

### 2. Learning Progress Curriculum
- **Sampling**: Probability proportional to learning progress
- **Progress Measurement**: EMA difference method
  - Fast EMA: $\text{EMA}_f(t) = (1 - \alpha_f) \cdot \text{EMA}_f(t-1) + \alpha_f \cdot P(t)$
  - Slow EMA: $\text{EMA}_s(t) = (1 - \alpha_s) \cdot \text{EMA}_s(t-1) + \alpha_s \cdot P(t)$
  - Progress: $|\text{EMA}_f(t) - \text{EMA}_s(t)|$
- **Adaptation**: Dynamic focus on tasks with highest learning momentum

### 3. Oracle Curriculum
- **Sampling**: Focuses on optimal task order (topological sort)
- **Strategy**: Sequential mastery - moves to next task when current reaches threshold
- **Knowledge**: Perfect knowledge of task dependencies and optimal ordering
- **Fair Comparison**: Uses the same dynamical system as other curricula

## Success Metrics

### 1. Learning Efficiency
- **Definition**: Area under the curve of average performance over time
- **Calculation**: $\text{Efficiency} = \int_0^T \bar{P}(t) \, dt$
- **Interpretation**: Higher values indicate more sample-efficient learning

### 2. Time to Threshold
- **Definition**: Number of epochs required for all tasks to exceed threshold (e.g., 0.9)
- **Calculation**: $\min\{t : \forall i, P_i(t) \geq \text{threshold}\}$
- **Interpretation**: Lower values indicate faster mastery

### 3. Final Performance
- **Definition**: Average performance across all tasks at the end of training
- **Calculation**: $\bar{P}(T)$
- **Interpretation**: Overall mastery level achieved

- **Transfer Parameter ($\gamma$)**: Controls how much parent tasks help child learning
- **Forgetting Parameter ($\lambda$)**: Controls how quickly performance decays
- **Progress Temperature**: Controls exploration vs exploitation in learning progress
