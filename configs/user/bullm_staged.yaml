# Staged Progressive Curriculum Training Configuration
# This demonstrates how to use the new StagedProgressiveCurriculum to replace
# multi-stage training with a single training run that automatically transitions
# between different curriculum stages.

defaults:
  - /trainer/trainer
  - /sim/all@evals  # Use comprehensive evaluation suite
  - _self_

# Basic run configuration
run: bullm_staged
data_dir: ${oc.env:DATA_DIR,./train_dir}
run_dir: ${data_dir}/${run}

trainer:
  # Use the new staged progressive curriculum
  curriculum: env/mettagrid/curriculum/staged_progressive_example
  evaluate_interval: 100
  total_timesteps: 2000000  # Longer training to allow for stage transitions
  num_workers: 4

# WandB configuration
wandb:
  enabled: true

# The staged progressive curriculum will automatically:
# 1. Start with navigation training
# 2. Transition to navigation sequence when performance reaches 80%
# 3. Transition to simple tasks when performance reaches 80%
# 4. Log all stage transitions and performance metrics to WandB
