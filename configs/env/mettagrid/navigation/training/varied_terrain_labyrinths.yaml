# This YAML file configures the grid world environment using the VariedTerrainLabyrinths class.
# It scatters multiple obstacle types:
#   - Large obstacles (random shapes with target block counts),
#   - Small obstacles (similarly generated),
#   - Cross obstacles (cross-shaped patterns),
#   - Mini labyrinths (mazes no larger than ~11×11 with thicker, more open passages 
#     enforced via random thickening and at least two-cell wide border gaps, with hearts scattered inside),
#   - Scattered single wall cells.
# Additionally, heart altars are placed with a count sampled between 50 and 100.
# Other parameters (room dimensions, obstacle counts, clumpiness) are specified below.
