# Documentation Standards

## Task Planning
- Use ExitPlanMode tool for larger/ambiguous tasks
- Create plans in `.claude/tasks/TASK_NAME.md` with:
  - Clear problem statement
  - MVP approach (minimal viable solution first)
  - Step-by-step implementation plan
  - Success criteria
- Update plans as living documentation during work

## Plan Template Structure
```markdown
# Task: [TASK_NAME]
## Problem Statement
[Clear description]
## MVP Approach  
[Minimal solution]
## Implementation Plan
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
## Success Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
## Implementation Updates
[Updated during work]
```

## Documentation Principles
- Keep concise - focus on what changed and why, not how
- Document completed steps after major milestones
- Track deviations from plan with reasoning
- Don't create unnecessary documentation files unless requested
- Use real file references with line numbers: `file_path:line_number`
