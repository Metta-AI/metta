# Movement directions for move_8way:
# 0 = North
# 1 = Northeast
# 2 = East
# 3 = Southeast
# 4 = South
# 5 = Southwest
# 6 = West

# Note: 8-way movement does NOT change agent orientation.
# Agents maintain their facing direction for actions like attack.
# Only the rotate action changes orientation.
