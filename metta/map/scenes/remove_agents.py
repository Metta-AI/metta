    This class solves a frequent problem: `game.num_agents` must match the
    number of agents in the map.

    You can use this scene to remove agents from the map. Then apply `Random`
    scene to place as many agents as you want.

    (TODO - it might be better to remove `game.num_agents` from the config
    entirely, and just use the number of agents in the map.)
