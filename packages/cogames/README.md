# CoGames: Cogs vs Clips Multi-Agent RL Environment

CoGames is a collection of multi-agent cooperative and competitive environments designed for reinforcement learning
research. The primary focus is the **Cogs vs Clips** competition - a challenging multi-agent resource management and
assembly game built on the MettagGrid framework.

## üéÆ Cogs vs Clips Competition

In Cogs vs Clips, multiple "Cog" agents must cooperate to gather resources, operate machinery, and assemble components
to achieve objectives. The environment features:

- **Multi-agent cooperation**: Agents must coordinate to efficiently use shared resources and stations
- **Resource management**: Energy, materials (carbon, oxygen, geranium, silicon), and crafted components
- **Station-based interactions**: Different stations provide unique capabilities (extractors, assemblers, chargers,
  chests)
- **Sparse rewards**: Agents receive rewards only upon successfully crafting target items (hearts)
- **Partial observability**: Agents have limited visibility of the environment

### Game Mechanics

**Resources:**

- `energy`: Consumed for movement and operating extractors
- `carbon`, `oxygen`, `geranium`, `silicon`: Base materials extracted from stations
- `heart`: The target objective item
- `disruptor`, `modulator`, `resonator`, `scrabbler`: Advanced components

**Station Types:**

- **Charger**: Provides energy to agents
- **Extractors** (Carbon/Oxygen/Geranium/Silicon): Convert energy into materials
- **Assembler**: Combines resources to create components or objectives
- **Chest**: Storage for resource sharing between agents

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install the package
uv pip install cogames
```

### Running Your First Game

```bash
# List all available games
cogames games

# Play a simple single-agent assembler scenario
cogames play assembler_1_simple --steps 100 --render

# Play a multi-agent scenario
cogames play assembler_2_complex --steps 200 --render

# Run without rendering for faster execution
cogames play machina_2 --no-render --steps 500
```

## ü§ñ For RL Researchers

### Training a Policy

CoGames integrates with standard RL training frameworks. Currently supports:

- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)
- DQN (Deep Q-Networks)

```bash
# Train a PPO agent on a single-agent scenario
cogames train assembler_1_simple --algorithm ppo --steps 50000 --save ./my_policy.ckpt

# Train with Weights & Biases logging
cogames train assembler_2_complex --algorithm ppo --steps 100000 --wandb my-project
```

### Evaluating Policies

```bash
# Evaluate a trained policy
cogames evaluate assembler_1_simple ./my_policy.ckpt --episodes 100

# Evaluate with video recording
cogames evaluate assembler_2_complex ./my_policy.ckpt --episodes 10 --render --video ./evaluation.mp4

# Baseline comparison with random policy
cogames evaluate assembler_1_simple random --episodes 100
```

### Implementing Custom Policies

Create your own policy by extending the `Policy` base class:

```python
from cogames.policy import Policy
from typing import Any, Optional
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyCustomPolicy(Policy):
    def __init__(self, observation_space, action_space):
        self.network = MyNeuralNetwork(observation_space, action_space)

    def get_action(self, observation: Any, agent_id: Optional[int] = None) -> Any:
        """Compute action from observation."""
        with torch.no_grad():
            action_logits = self.network(observation)
            action = torch.argmax(action_logits).item()
        return action

    def reset(self) -> None:
        """Reset any internal state (e.g., RNN hidden states)."""
        pass

    def save(self, path: str) -> None:
        """Save model checkpoint."""
        torch.save(self.network.state_dict(), path)

    @classmethod
    def load(cls, path: str, env=None) -> "MyCustomPolicy":
        """Load model from checkpoint."""
        policy = cls(env.observation_space, env.action_space)
        policy.network.load_state_dict(torch.load(path))
        return policy
```

### Environment API

The underlying MettagGrid environment follows the Gymnasium API:

```python
from cogames import get_game
from mettagrid.envs import MettaGridEnv

# Load a game configuration
config = get_game("assembler_2_complex")

# Create environment
env = MettaGridEnv(env_cfg=config)

# Reset environment
obs, info = env.reset()

# Game loop
for step in range(1000):
    # Your policy computes actions for all agents
    actions = policy.get_actions(obs)  # Dict[agent_id, action]

    # Step environment
    obs, rewards, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(actions)

    if terminated or truncated:
        obs, info = env.reset()
```

### Observation Space

Observations are dictionaries containing:

- `rgb`: RGB image of the agent's view (H√óW√ó3)
- `inventory`: Agent's current resources
- `position`: Agent's (x, y) coordinates
- `orientation`: Agent's facing direction
- `glyph`: Agent's current communication symbol

### Action Space

Available actions:

- `0`: No-op (do nothing)
- `1-4`: Move (forward, backward, left, right)
- `5-8`: Rotate (turn left/right)
- `9-24`: Change glyph (for communication)
- Additional actions may be available based on scenario

## üìä Available Scenarios

### Tutorial Scenarios

## üîß Creating Custom Scenarios

```python
from cogames.cogs_vs_clips.scenarios import make_game

# Create a custom game configuration
config = make_game(
    num_cogs=4,                    # Number of agents
    num_assemblers=2,              # Number of assembler stations
    num_chargers=1,                # Energy stations
    num_carbon_extractors=1,       # Material extractors
    num_oxygen_extractors=1,
    num_geranium_extractors=1,
    num_silicon_extractors=1,
    num_chests=2,                  # Storage chests
)

# Modify map size
config.game.map_builder.width = 15
config.game.map_builder.height = 15

# Save configuration
cogames make-scenario --name my_scenario --agents 4 --width 15 --height 15 --output my_scenario.yaml
```

## üèÜ Competition Tips

1. **Coordination is Key**: Multi-agent scenarios require effective coordination. Consider:
   - Task allocation strategies
   - Communication through glyph changes
   - Resource sharing via chests

2. **Energy Management**: Energy is limited and required for most actions:
   - Plan efficient paths
   - Use chargers strategically
   - Balance exploration vs exploitation

3. **Hierarchical Planning**: Break down the assembly task:
   - Gathering phase (collect base materials)
   - Processing phase (operate extractors)
   - Assembly phase (combine at assemblers)

4. **Curriculum Learning**: Start with simpler scenarios:
   - Master single-agent tasks first
   - Graduate to multi-agent coordination
   - Increase complexity gradually
