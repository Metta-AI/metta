    Sample actions from unnormalized logits and compute associated log-probabilities and entropy.
    Optimized for performance, numerical stability, and TorchScript compatibility.
    Uses explicit reshaping operations to maintain strict control over tensor dimensions.

        logits: Unnormalized logits of shape [B*T, A]
