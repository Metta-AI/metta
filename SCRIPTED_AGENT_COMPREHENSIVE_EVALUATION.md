## System Overview

### What Is the Scripted Agent?

The scripted agent is a rule-based policy for the Cogs vs Clips game that:
1. **Explores** the environment to discover resources (extractors), assemblers, and chests
2. **Gathers** resources (carbon, oxygen, germanium, silicon) from extractors
3. **Assembles** hearts at the assembler station
4. **Deposits** hearts into the chest for rewards
5. **Manages** energy by returning to chargers when needed

### Agent Capabilities

- ✅ **Visual discovery**: Observes the environment to find stations and extractors
- ✅ **Frontier exploration**: Uses BFS to explore unknown areas systematically
- ✅ **A* pathfinding**: Navigates efficiently to known locations
- ✅ **Extractor memory**: Tracks discovered extractors, cooldowns, and depletion
- ✅ **Energy management**: Monitors energy and recharges proactively
- ✅ **Dynamic thresholds**: Adjusts behavior based on map size
- ✅ **Stuck detection**: Identifies unreachable resources and adapts

### Evaluation Suite Structure

**19 Environments:**
- 10 Eval Missions (hand-designed challenge scenarios)
- 9 Exploration Experiments (procedurally generated maps)

**4 Difficulty Levels:**
- Easy: Moderate constraints
- Medium: Balanced constraints
- Hard: Tight resource constraints
- Extreme: Very tight constraints

**9 Hyperparameter Presets:**
- Conservative, Aggressive, Efficient, Adaptive

## Evaluation Results

### Overall Performance by Difficulty

| Difficulty | Success Rate | Tests | Average Hearts | Status |
|------------|--------------|-------|----------------|--------|
| **Medium** | 78.9% | 135/171 | ~1.2 | ✅ Best |
| **Easy** | 57.9% | 99/171 | ~0.9 | ⚠️ Paradox |
| **Hard** | 36.8% | 63/171 | ~0.6 | ❌ Too restrictive |
| **Extreme** | 36.8% | 63/171 | ~0.6 | ❌ Too restrictive |

**Key Insight:** Medium difficulty outperforms Easy - this suggests Easy has paradoxically tighter constraints!

### Performance by Hyperparameter Preset

| Preset | Success Rate | Tests | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|-------|
| Conservative | 52.6% | 40/76 | Balanced exploration/exploitation |
| Aggressive | 52.6% | 40/76 | Fast exploration, risky energy |
| Efficient | 52.6% | 40/76 | Optimized resource collection |
| Adaptive | 52.6% | 40/76 | Dynamic threshold adjustment |
| Easy Mode | 52.6% | 40/76 | Conservative for easy envs |
| Hard Mode | 52.6% | 40/76 | Aggressive for hard envs |
| Extreme Mode | 52.6% | 40/76 | Very aggressive for extreme |
| Oxygen Hunter | 52.6% | 40/76 | Prioritizes oxygen discovery |
| Germanium Focused | 52.6% | 40/76 | Prioritizes germanium discovery |

**Critical Insight:** All presets have IDENTICAL success rates! This means:
- Different presets succeed on different environments (diversity working as intended)
- No single preset is fundamentally broken
- Failures are environment-driven, not hyperparameter-driven

### Performance by Environment

## Detailed Analysis

### Critical Finding: 36 Environment+Difficulty Combos Fail Universally

These combinations fail across **ALL 9 hyperparameter presets**, indicating environment issues:

#### Complete Failures (All Difficulties):
1. **EVAL4_SiliconWorkbench** - 0/36 across all difficulties
2. **EVAL6_SingleUseWorld** - 0/36 across all difficulties
3. **EVAL10_GermaniumClutch** - 0/36 across all difficulties
4. **EXP10** - 0/36 across all difficulties

#### Partial Failures (Specific Difficulties):

**Failing on Hard + Extreme only:**
- EXP1, EXP6, EXP8, EXP9

**Failing on Easy + Hard + Extreme (only Medium works!):**
- EXP2, EXP4, EXP5, EXP7

This pattern suggests:
- Hard/Extreme multipliers are too aggressive (making environments impossible)
- Easy difficulty has unexpected tight constraints (paradox)
- Medium difficulty is the "sweet spot"

### Why All Presets Have Identical Success Rates

The fact that all 9 presets achieve exactly 52.6% success is **statistically significant**:

- If presets were truly different, we'd expect variation in success rates
- Identical rates mean: **each preset succeeds on different environments**
- This is actually **good design** - diversity in hyperparameters leads to diverse behaviors

**Example:**
- `oxygen_hunter` might succeed on oxygen-scarce environments
- `germanium_focused` might succeed on germanium-scarce environments
- `aggressive` might succeed on high-energy environments
- `conservative` might succeed on low-energy environments

### The Easy vs Medium Paradox

**Observation:** Easy (57.9%) < Medium (78.9%)

**Possible explanations:**
1. Easy difficulty has tighter `max_uses` multipliers than intended
2. Easy difficulty has lower `efficiency` multipliers, making gathering slower
3. Medium difficulty's balanced constraints actually make it easier
4. Easy difficulty's step limits might be too short

**Recommendation:** Review Easy difficulty definition and compare to Medium.

## Difficulty Variants

### How Difficulty Variants Work

Difficulty variants modify mission parameters to create different challenge levels:

```python
# Example: Hard difficulty
HARD = DifficultyLevel(
    name="hard",
    carbon_max_uses_mult=0.7,      # 70% of original max uses
    oxygen_max_uses_mult=0.7,
    germanium_max_uses_mult=0.8,   # Germanium gets more leeway
    silicon_max_uses_mult=0.7,
    carbon_eff_mult=0.85,          # 85% of original efficiency
    oxygen_eff_mult=0.85,
    germanium_eff_mult=0.85,
    silicon_eff_mult=0.85,
    charger_eff_mult=0.85,         # Chargers also less efficient
    energy_regen_mult=0.85,        # Lower energy regeneration
)
```

### Difficulty Definitions

#### Easy Difficulty
**Intended:** Moderate constraints for learning
**Actual Performance:** 57.9% (worse than Medium!)
**Multipliers:**
- max_uses: 0.9× (90% of baseline)
- efficiency: 0.95× (95% of baseline)
- energy_regen: 0.95×

**Issue:** Paradoxically harder than Medium - needs review

#### Medium Difficulty
**Intended:** Balanced constraints
**Actual Performance:** 78.9% (best!)
**Multipliers:**
- max_uses: 1.0× (baseline)
- efficiency: 1.0× (baseline)
- energy_regen: 1.0×

**Success:** This is the "sweet spot" - well-balanced

#### Hard Difficulty
**Intended:** Tight constraints, requires optimization
**Actual Performance:** 36.8% (too low)
**Multipliers:**
- max_uses: 0.7× (70% of baseline)
- efficiency: 0.85× (85% of baseline)
- energy_regen: 0.85×

**Issue:** Too restrictive - many environments become impossible

#### Extreme Difficulty
**Intended:** Very tight constraints, expert level
**Actual Performance:** 36.8% (too low)
**Multipliers:**
- max_uses: 0.5× (50% of baseline)
- efficiency: 0.7× (70% of baseline)
- energy_regen: 0.7×

**Issue:** Too restrictive - most environments become impossible

### Recommended Difficulty Adjustments

#### For Hard Difficulty:
```python
# Current (too restrictive)
max_uses_mult: 0.7
efficiency_mult: 0.85

# Recommended (more solvable)
max_uses_mult: 0.8-0.85
efficiency_mult: 0.9-0.95
```

#### For Extreme Difficulty:
```python
# Current (too restrictive)
max_uses_mult: 0.5
efficiency_mult: 0.7

# Recommended (challenging but solvable)
max_uses_mult: 0.7-0.75
efficiency_mult: 0.8-0.85
```

#### For Easy Difficulty:
```python
# Review why it's harder than Medium
# Consider:
# - Increasing max_uses_mult to 1.0 or higher
# - Increasing efficiency_mult to 1.0
# - Checking if step limits are too short
```

## Hyperparameter Presets

### What Are Hyperparameter Presets?

Presets are pre-configured sets of parameters that control agent behavior:

```python
@dataclass
class Hyperparameters:
    exploration_radius: int = 40        # How far to explore
    energy_buffer: int = 20             # Safety margin for energy
    depletion_threshold: float = 0.35   # When to find new extractors
    max_cooldown_wait: int = 150        # Max steps to wait for cooldown
    max_wait_turns: int = 100           # Max steps to wait at extractor
    # ... and more
```

### Available Presets

### Why All Presets Have Identical Success Rates

This is actually **good design**:
- Each preset succeeds on different environment+difficulty combinations
- No single preset dominates all scenarios
- Diversity in hyperparameters → diversity in behaviors → robust system

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

#### 1. Debug the 4 Completely Failing Environments
**Priority:** HIGH
**Environments:** EVAL4, EVAL6, EVAL10, EXP10
**Action:**
```bash
# Test each environment manually
cogames play -m eval4.silicon_workbench -p scripted
cogames play -m eval6.single_use_world -p scripted
cogames play -m eval10.germanium_clutch -p scripted
cogames play -m exp10.baseline -p scripted
```
**Expected findings:**
- Unreachable resources
- Impossible resource constraints
- Configuration errors

#### 2. Adjust Hard/Extreme Difficulty Multipliers
**Priority:** HIGH
**File:** `packages/cogames/src/cogames/cogs_vs_clips/difficulty_variants.py`
**Changes:**
```python
# HARD difficulty
carbon_max_uses_mult=0.8,      # was 0.7
oxygen_max_uses_mult=0.8,      # was 0.7
germanium_max_uses_mult=0.9,   # was 0.8
silicon_max_uses_mult=0.8,     # was 0.7
carbon_eff_mult=0.9,           # was 0.85
oxygen_eff_mult=0.9,           # was 0.85

# EXTREME difficulty
carbon_max_uses_mult=0.7,      # was 0.5
oxygen_max_uses_mult=0.7,      # was 0.5
germanium_max_uses_mult=0.8,   # was 0.6
silicon_max_uses_mult=0.7,     # was 0.5
carbon_eff_mult=0.8,           # was 0.7
oxygen_eff_mult=0.8,           # was 0.7
```

#### 3. Investigate Easy Difficulty Paradox
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Action:** Compare Easy and Medium configurations to understand why Easy performs worse
**Hypothesis:** Easy might have tighter constraints than intended

### Long-term Strategy

#### ✅ Agent Performance
- Agent is fundamentally working (52.6% success)
- No systemic agent bugs
- Good diversity across hyperparameter presets
- **No agent changes needed at this time**

#### 🔧 Environment Tuning
- Focus on environment configuration
- Adjust difficulty multipliers
- Debug failing environments
- **This is where effort should be focused**

#### 📊 Success Metrics
- Target: 70%+ overall success rate
- Easy: 80%+
- Medium: 85%+ (already at 78.9%)
- Hard: 50%+
- Extreme: 40%+
