# MettaScope

MettaScope is a browser viewer to watch metta replays.

## Project layout

- ./mettascope/src/ has the frontend typescript source.
- ./mettascope/server.py is a small python backend for serving replays.
- ./mettascope/tests/ has both frontend UI tests with Playwright, and some python backend tests.
- ./mettascope/index.html do not edit index.html! It is auto generated by an engineer with a script from Figma.

The code is plain TypeScript with no framework.

## Useful commands

All commands are executed from the `mettascope/` directory.

### Texture Atlas

- a texture atlas is generated from the data/atlas/ directory.
- this is used to generate dist/atlas.png and dist/atlas.json.
- the atlas is generated by running:

```bash
python tools/gen_atlas.py
```

## Commit guidelines

Follow the repository-wide rules described in `/AGENTS.md`:

- Short, present-tense commit messages
- Run lint/format before pushing

## Programming Guidelines

- when working with `gridObject`s, do not access properties directly. you must use `getAttr()` from replay.ts
