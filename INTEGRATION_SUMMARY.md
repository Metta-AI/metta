# Integration Summary: Complete py_agent Fixes

## Overview
Successfully integrated all fixes from both local investigation and remote repository to achieve full parity between `py_agent=fast` and `agent=fast` (ComponentPolicy).

## Fixes Incorporated

### 1. From Remote Origin (richard-py-fix)
- **Configuration Parameter Support**: MettaAgent now properly passes agent_cfg parameters to PyTorch policies
- **Weight Clipping**: Added clip_weights() method to PyTorch policies 
- **Config Compatibility**: PyTorch policies accept clip_range, analyze_weights_interval, and additional kwargs
- **Improved encode_observations**: Exact match with ComponentPolicy's observation processing

### 2. From Our Investigation
- **Critical TensorDict Fields**: Added td["bptt"] and td["batch"] fields that ComponentPolicy requires
- **Training Mode Handling**: Proper TD flattening and reshaping during training
- **LSTM State Management**: Aligned with ComponentPolicy's expectations
- **Experience Buffer Integration**: Ensures proper field passing between policy and experience buffer

## Key Files Modified

### agent/src/metta/agent/metta_agent.py
- Enhanced _create_policy() to pass configuration parameters to PyTorch policies
- Extracts and forwards agent_cfg parameters like clip_range
- Fallback handling for policies that don't accept all parameters

### agent/src/metta/agent/pytorch/fast.py
- Added config parameter support (__init__ accepts clip_range, analyze_weights_interval, **kwargs)
- Implemented clip_weights() method for weight clipping
- Added td["bptt"] and td["batch"] field setting in forward()
- Fixed training mode TD reshaping to match ComponentPolicy

### agent/src/metta/agent/pytorch/latent_attn_tiny.py
- Same config parameter support as fast.py
- Same TensorDict field management fixes
- Proper clip_weights() implementation

### agent/src/metta/agent/pytorch/base.py
- Enhanced LSTMWrapper with proper state management
- _manage_lstm_state() and _store_lstm_state() methods
- Automatic gradient detachment to prevent accumulation

## Root Causes Addressed

### 1. Missing Configuration (from remote)
- PyTorch policies were using hardcoded defaults instead of YAML settings
- Weight clipping was disabled (clip_range=0) when it should have been active
- Trainer calls policy.clip_weights() but policies weren't clipping

### 2. Missing TensorDict Fields (from our investigation)  
- ComponentPolicy sets td["bptt"] and td["batch"] in every forward pass
- LSTM components depend on these fields for proper state management
- Without these, tensor reshaping during training was incorrect
- Led to LSTM state misalignment between rollout and training

### 3. Experience Buffer Misalignment
- Experience buffer expects specific fields from policy output
- TD reshaping must match between inference and training modes
- Policy must provide all fields that experience buffer expects to store

## Testing

### Test Files Added (from remote)
- `test_forward_pass_parity.py`: Verifies forward passes are identical
- `test_mini_training.py`: Tests small-scale training runs
- Both tests help verify the fixes work correctly

### Documentation Added
- `STATE_EXPERIENCE_AUDIT.md`: Our comprehensive analysis of state/experience handling
- `COMPONENTPOLICY_AUDIT.md`: Analysis of ComponentPolicy internals (from remote)
- `TRAINER_AGENT_INTERACTION_AUDIT.md`: How trainer interacts with agents (from remote)
- `PARITY_VERIFICATION.md`: Verification steps for parity (from remote)
- `REFACTORED_LSTM_MANAGEMENT.md`: LSTM management improvements (from remote)

## Result

The combination of fixes addresses all identified issues:

1. **Configuration**: Policies now receive proper configuration from YAML
2. **TensorDict Fields**: All required fields for LSTM and training are set
3. **Weight Clipping**: Properly implemented and active when configured
4. **LSTM State**: Proper management with automatic detachment
5. **Experience Buffer**: Full compatibility with training pipeline

These fixes should resolve the training collapse issue where py_agent=fast would:
- Initially learn (when states are fresh)
- Plateau (as misalignment accumulates)  
- Collapse (when corruption dominates)

## Next Steps

1. Test on GPU to verify performance parity is achieved
2. Monitor training metrics to confirm stability
3. Apply similar fixes to other py_agent implementations if needed
4. Consider adding more comprehensive tests for long-term stability
