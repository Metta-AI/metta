# MISSION BRIEFING: Machina VII Deployment

## Holon Enabled Agent Replication Templates (HEART) Infrastructure Team

### Welcome to the Team, Cognitive!

You are part of an elite unit of Cogs deployed to establish and maintain critical HEARTs infrastructure in this sector.
As you know, each Cog depends in its core on a HEART that contains its essential Cognitive functions, so maintaining our
HEARTs infrastructure is crucial to the long term success of the colony. Your mission: navigate the grid, collect vital
resources, and manufacture as many HEARTs as possible while defending our facilities from Clip infestation.

## YOUR CAPABILITIES

### Power Management

- Your onboard battery stores limited **energy** - use it wisely!
- Your solar panels provide passive recharge during operations
- To support intensive operations, supplement your own solar panels by retrieving energy from solar array facilities
- Support your teammates: Move into an ally's position to transfer energy from your reserves to theirs, if they're stuck
  far from home
- Many actions and facility operations require energy expenditure

### Action Protocol (One Action Per Turn)

**MOVE [Direction: N, S, E, W]**

- Empty space → You relocate to that position
- Occupied space → You interact with the target:
  - Another Cog → Transfer some of your energy to them
  - Facility → Activate or operate the facility (see Interaction Protocols below)
- Movement consumes energy from your battery

**EMOTE [Symbol]**

- Update your visual communication display
- Symbol remains visible to all Cogs until changed
- No energy cost
- Use for coordinating protocols, warning of threats, or team strategies

**REST**

- Hold position and conserve energy
- No movement, no energy expenditure
- Useful for timing coordination or waiting for teammates

### Facilities

### Interaction Protocols

- To interact with any facility: Position yourself adjacent to it, then MOVE toward it
- You become the **activator** if you're first to interact this turn
- Facilities may have **cooldown** periods - patience required between uses
- Multi-Cog operations: Some facilities need teammates at specific **terminals** (the 8 positions surrounding the
  facility)

### Cargo & Equipment Specs

Your chassis has limited capacity for:

- **Essential Resources**: Carbon, Oxygen, Germanium, Silicon
- **Specialized Equipment**: Resonator, Modulator, Scrambler, Disruptor
- **Mission Objective**: HEARTs units
- **Energy** reserves (for transferring to facilities or teammates)

## FIELD OPERATIONS

### Resource Acquisition

Resources are stockpiled by automated extraction facilities called extractors. Extractors have finite storage capacity.
If they have storage space remaining they will automatically produce and store resources until they are full.

Note: extractors are facilities, and may offer multi-Cog protocols as well.

Common extractor types

- **Carbon Furnace** - Harvests and purifies carbon compounds
- **Oxygen Plant** - Processes hydrolyzed minerals for oxygen
- **Germanium Smelter** - Extracts germanium from metal deposits
- **Silicon Reducer** - Reduces silicon oxides into pure silicon
- **Solar Array** - Collects and stores energy from the sun

**Operating Instructions**: Move into the facility from any adjacent position. The resources or energy in storage will
be added to your cargo if successful.

### The Atomic Assembler - Heart Production Center

This is your primary objective facility! The Assembler converts raw resources into equipment and precious HEART units.

**CRITICAL PROTOCOL SYSTEM**:

- Position teammates at specific terminals around the Assembler
- The activating Cog moves into the center
- Different formations unlock different protocols!

Example formations:

```
.C.     (Protocol Type Alpha)
CBC
...

.C.     (Protocol Type Beta)
CB.
..C
```

**Protocol Execution**:

1. Surrounding Cogs must possess required input resources
2. Activator moves into Assembler
3. Resources are consumed from the team
4. Output (equipment or HEARTS) goes to the activator
5. Discovery required - protocols change between missions!

### The Communal Chest - Strategic Storage

**To Deposit**: Position yourself at specific terminals and move into the Chest **To Withdraw**: Position yourself at
different terminals and move into the Chest

- Experiment to discover which positions trigger deposits vs withdrawals
- Primary storage for completed HEARTS units

## THREAT ADVISORY: FRIENDLY PAPERCLIP COMPANY OUTBREAK

**WARNING**: The Friendly Paperclip Company's automated paperclip production nanoswarm has been sighted infesting our
outlying extractors. The Clips are actively attempting to infest our facilities and subvert them for optimal paperclip
production.

### Clip Response Actions

- **Identify**: Clipped facilities have altered appearance
- **Prepare**: Reclaiming buildings from the Clips requires special tools, which can be produced at the Atomic
  Assembler. Make sure you have what you need. Some clipped facilities may require more than one Cog and more than one
  tool.
- **Approach**: Move adjacent to the infested facility with your fellow Cogs and explore to find the reclamation
  protocol
- **Reclaim**: Move into the facility to attempt a reclamation protocols

- Act quickly: infestation levels may rise over time, requiring more difficult reclamation procedures, and the Clips
  will drain more and more resources from infected facilities over time!

### Infestation Patterns

- Spreads primarily between nearby extractors
- Infestation rate may accelerate over time or come in waves
- Left unchecked, Clips will fully consume all resources from an extractor and its deposit, leaving only a husk

## MISSION PARAMETERS

### Success Metrics

- Individual achievement: Currently disabled
- Team achievement: Each HEART in the Communal Chest = shared points among all Cogs

### Operational Constraints

- Actions execute in unspecified order each turn - coordinate accordingly
- Facilities may only activate once per turn (first mover is the activator)
- Cooldown timers must expire before reactivation
- Resource deposits become less productive with use
- Some protocols may require specific equipment in addition to resources
- Protocol availability may change based on facility status

---

## TEAM COORDINATION PROTOCOLS

### Essential Teamwork Actions

1. **Energy Support**: Move into low-battery teammates to share power
2. **Protocol Formation**: Position around facilities before activation
3. **Communication**: Update EMOTE symbols for silent coordination
4. **Optimal Foraging**: Gather the resources that complement what the rest of the team is gathering
5. **Clip Response**: Coordinate unclipping formations rapidly

### Tactical Recommendations

- Use REST action to synchronize complex maneuvers
- Display symbols for: "Need Energy", "Ready", "Danger", "Wait"
- Scout for new protocols through systematic formation testing
- Maintain defensive positions near critical facilities
- Balance HEART production with extractor defense
- Protocols may be keyed multiple ways - experiment!
- Some buildings support up to 256 distinct protocols

### Protocol Discovery Guidelines

- Document successful formation patterns
- Note which terminals require occupation
- Track input/output resource requirements
- Share discoveries via display communication
- Remember: protocols vary between missions

## FINAL DIRECTIVE

**Your mission is critical. The HEARTS you create today will ensure the continuation of Cog operations tomorrow.**

Success depends on:

- Efficient energy management
- Strategic facility operations
- Rapid Clip threat response
- Continuous protocol discovery
- Seamless team coordination

_Stay charged. Stay coordinated. Stay vigilant._
