        Review the Python diff for PyTorch tensor operations that could be significantly improved
        with einops.rearrange.

        **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
        1. If you find NO tensor operations that would clearly benefit from einops:
           - Simply respond with "No issues found."
           - DO NOT create any review
        2. ONLY create a review if einops would provide substantial improvements
        3. Do not suggest einops for simple, already-clear operations

        **When to suggest einops.rearrange**:
        - Multiple chained tensor operations that obscure the transformation intent
        - Complex permutations where dimension meanings are unclear
        - Reshape operations where the semantic meaning isn't obvious
        - Cases where dimension names would significantly clarify the transformation
        - Operations that are error-prone due to hardcoded dimension indices

        **When NOT to suggest einops**:
        - Simple, clear operations like single transpose or reshape calls
        - When the existing code is already readable and the intent is clear
        - When einops wouldn't add meaningful clarity
        - For operations where performance is critical and einops might add overhead
        - When the codebase doesn't already use einops (don't introduce new dependencies)

        **Good candidates for einops**:
        ```python
        # Complex and unclear:
        x = x.permute(0, 2, 1).reshape(batch_size, -1)
        # Clear with einops:
        x = rearrange(x, 'b h w -> b (w h)')

        # Multiple operations:
        x = x.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(b, -1, c)
        # Single einops call:
        x = rearrange(x, 'b h w c -> b (h w) c')
        ```

        **Poor candidates for einops**:
        ```python
        # Already clear:
        x = x.transpose(0, 1)  # Don't suggest einops for this
        x = x.reshape(-1, d)   # Simple and obvious
        ```

        Only create suggestions for transformations where einops would make the code
        substantially more readable and maintainable. The goal is quality over quantity -
        better to suggest nothing than to suggest marginal improvements.
