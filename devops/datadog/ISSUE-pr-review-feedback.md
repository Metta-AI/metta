## Review Comments Summary

From PR review on 2025-10-23:

> - definitely the general idea of multiple data collectors and a separate thing for dashboard management sound good âœ…
> - interface for collectors looks solid âœ…
> - i'd make sure that {service}.{category}.{metric_name} is the right topology for metrics -- that it lends itself nicely to the first ways we want to show things in the dashboard. datadog also has tags, beyond just metrics names. and i dont know how easy it is to split on metric names
> - i'd prefer typer apps over makefiles; makes composing them easier, which we're already doing a bunch of in other parts of the code
> - the actual metrics selected here don't feel super well-chosen but i'm guessing those parts may be ai generated

## Issues to Address

### 1. Metric Naming Topology & Tags Strategy

**Concern**: Current `{service}.{category}.{metric_name}` pattern needs validation
- Need to ensure it works well with dashboard queries
- Datadog has tags - should we be using those instead of/in addition to metric names?
- Splitting on metric names may not be easy in Datadog queries

**Current Pattern**:
```python
# Examples from current implementation
github.prs.open
github.prs.merged_7d
github.commits.total_7d
github.ci.workflow_runs_7d
```

**Questions**:
1. Should we use tags for categories instead?
   ```python
   # Alternative: Use tags
   github.metric_value  # tags: category:prs, name:open
   github.metric_value  # tags: category:commits, name:total_7d
   ```

2. How do we want to query in dashboards?
   - Group by service? (all GitHub metrics together)
   - Group by category? (all PR metrics across services)
   - Mix and match?

3. What's Datadog's best practice for metric organization?
   - Flat namespace with tags?
   - Hierarchical metric names?
   - Hybrid approach?

**Investigation Needed**:
- [ ] Research Datadog metric naming best practices
- [ ] Test dashboard queries with current naming pattern
- [ ] Test dashboard queries with tag-based approach
- [ ] Review how existing Datadog integrations organize metrics
- [ ] Check if we can easily filter/group by metric name segments
- [ ] Prototype both approaches in a test dashboard

**Decision Criteria**:
- Ease of creating dashboard widgets
- Flexibility for future aggregations
- Consistency with Datadog ecosystem
- Query performance

### 2. Replace Makefile with Typer CLI âœ…

**Concern**: Prefer typer apps over Makefiles for better composability

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** (2025-10-23, commit 900b2278b1)

**Current Implementation** (was):
```makefile
# devops/datadog/Makefile
make build      # Build dashboards from Jsonnet
make push       # Push dashboards to Datadog
make list       # List dashboards
make pull       # Download dashboards
```

**Proposed Change**: Create a unified Typer CLI

```python
# devops/datadog/cli.py
import typer

app = typer.Typer()

@app.command()
def build():
    """Build all dashboards from Jsonnet sources."""
    ...

@app.command()
def push():
    """Push dashboards to Datadog."""
    ...

@app.command()
def list():
    """List all dashboards in Datadog."""
    ...

@app.command()
def pull():
    """Download dashboards from Datadog."""
    ...

# Usage:
# uv run python -m devops.datadog.cli build
# uv run python -m devops.datadog.cli push
# Or via metta:
# metta datadog build
# metta datadog push
```

**Benefits**:
- Consistent with rest of Metta codebase (already using Typer in tools/run.py)
- Better composability - can import and call from other Python code
- Type safety and validation
- Better help text and documentation
- Easier to test

**Tasks**:
- [x] Create `devops/datadog/cli.py` with Typer app
- [x] Migrate all Makefile commands to Typer commands
- [x] Add command for running collectors: `metta datadog collect <collector_name>`
- [x] Add to metta CLI or create `metta datadog` subcommand
- [x] Update documentation to use CLI instead of Make
- [x] Remove Makefile entirely (decided not to keep wrapper)

**Implementation**:
- Created comprehensive Typer CLI with all dashboard and collector commands
- Integrated as `metta datadog` subcommand in metta_cli.py
- All commands tested and working
- Documentation updated (README.md, STATUS.md, etc.)

### 3. Review and Improve Metric Selection

**Concern**: Actual metrics selected don't feel super well-chosen

**Current Metrics** (17 implemented):
- `github.prs.open`, `github.prs.merged_7d`, `github.prs.closed_without_merge_7d`, `github.prs.avg_time_to_merge_hours`
- `github.branches.active`
- `github.commits.total_7d`, `github.commits.per_developer_7d`, `github.commits.hotfix`, `github.commits.reverts`
- `github.ci.workflow_runs_7d`, `github.ci.failed_workflows_7d`, `github.ci.avg_workflow_duration_minutes`, `github.ci.tests_passing_on_main`
- `github.developers.active_7d`
- `github.code.lines_added_7d`, `github.code.lines_deleted_7d`, `github.code.files_changed_7d` âœ… (fixed 2025-10-23)

**Questions to Answer**:
1. **What are we actually trying to measure?**
   - Developer productivity?
   - Code quality?
   - CI/CD health?
   - Project velocity?

2. **What metrics would be most valuable for decision-making?**
   - Example: Is "active branches" useful, or just noisy?
   - Example: Is "commits per developer" meaningful, or does it incentivize wrong behavior?

3. **What metrics align with team goals?**
   - Ship faster? â†’ Track PR merge time, CI duration
   - Maintain quality? â†’ Track test coverage, revert rate, CI failure rate
   - Team health? â†’ Track PR review time, work distribution

4. **Are there missing critical metrics?**
   - PR review turnaround time
   - Deployment frequency
   - Change failure rate (reverts/rollbacks)
   - Test flakiness
   - Code review coverage (% PRs reviewed before merge)

**Action Items**:
- [ ] **Meeting with team**: Discuss what metrics actually matter
- [ ] **Review existing dashboards**: What do we currently look at?
- [ ] **Define KPIs**: What are we trying to improve?
- [ ] **Prioritize metrics**: Which ones drive decisions vs. just noise?
- [ ] **Remove low-value metrics**: Cut metrics that don't inform actions
- [ ] **Add missing high-value metrics**: Fill gaps based on KPIs
- [ ] **Document metric rationale**: Why each metric exists and how to interpret it

**Potential Improvements**:
```python
# Focus on actionable metrics
github.velocity.deployment_frequency  # How often we ship
github.quality.change_failure_rate    # How often deployments cause issues
github.quality.mttr_hours             # Mean time to resolve issues
github.reviews.avg_time_to_first_review_hours  # Collaboration health
github.ci.p95_duration_minutes        # CI performance SLA
github.prs.stale_count                # Process health (PRs open >7 days)
```

### 4. Metric Organization Best Practices

**Additional Considerations**:

**Cardinality Concerns**:
- Are we creating too many unique metric names?
- Would tags reduce cardinality?
- Cost implications of metric count

**Aggregation Patterns**:
- Which metrics should be gauge vs. count vs. distribution?
- Do we need histogram metrics for CI duration?
- Should we emit percentiles (p50, p95, p99) or raw values?

**Tags Strategy**:
```python
# Example: Using tags effectively
metric_name = "github.workflow.duration"
tags = [
    "workflow:tests",
    "branch:main",
    "result:success",
    "repo:metta"
]
```

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Define standard tags for all GitHub metrics
- [ ] Research Datadog metric type best practices (gauge/count/rate/distribution)
- [ ] Document when to use tags vs. metric name hierarchy
- [ ] Create tag taxonomy for consistent labeling

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Investigation & Design (2-3 days)
- [ ] Research Datadog metric naming best practices
- [ ] Test current metric pattern in dashboard queries
- [ ] Prototype tag-based approach
- [ ] Meet with team to discuss metric selection
- [ ] Define KPIs and desired metrics
- [ ] Design Typer CLI structure

### Phase 2: Implementation (3-4 days)
- [ ] Refactor metric naming if needed (topology changes)
- [ ] Add/remove metrics based on team feedback
- [ ] Create Typer CLI for datadog commands
- [ ] Migrate Makefile commands to CLI
- [ ] Update collector interface for tags
- [ ] Add standard tags to all metrics

### Phase 3: Documentation & Testing (1-2 days)
- [ ] Update all documentation for new CLI
- [ ] Document metric naming conventions
- [ ] Document tag taxonomy
- [ ] Document metric rationale (why each exists)
- [ ] Test dashboard queries with new structure
- [ ] Update examples in README

### Phase 4: Review & Iterate (1 day)
- [ ] Request re-review from @nishu-builder
- [ ] Address any additional feedback
- [ ] Finalize before merge

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Metric naming pattern validated and documented
- [ ] Makefile replaced with Typer CLI
- [ ] Metrics reviewed and refined with team input
- [ ] All metrics have clear purpose/rationale documented
- [ ] Dashboard queries work smoothly with chosen topology
- [ ] Review feedback addressed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect changes

## Questions for Team

1. **Metric Topology**: Do you prefer hierarchical metric names (`github.prs.open`) or flat names with tags (`github.metric` + `category:prs`)?

2. **CLI Tool**: Should the Datadog CLI be:
   - Part of `metta` command: `metta datadog <subcommand>`
   - Standalone: `uv run python -m devops.datadog.cli <subcommand>`
   - Both (metta as wrapper)?

3. **Metrics Priority**: Which metrics are most valuable?
   - Developer productivity (velocity, throughput)
   - Code quality (test coverage, reverts)
   - CI/CD health (duration, failure rate)
   - Team collaboration (review time, PR discussions)

4. **Dashboard Focus**: What dashboards do we actually need?
   - Weekly team report?
   - Real-time CI health?
   - Monthly trends?
   - Individual contributor stats?

## Notes

- This addresses critical feedback before merging the PR
- Some changes (metric naming) may require updating existing dashboards
- Typer migration should be straightforward - we already use it elsewhere
- Metric selection requires team discussion - not a solo decision
