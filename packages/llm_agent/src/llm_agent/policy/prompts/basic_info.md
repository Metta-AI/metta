=== GOAL === Deposit HEARTs into CHEST to earn rewards. Team score = total hearts deposited.

╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

=== HOW TO PLAY ===

1. EXPLORE to find extractors (carbon, oxygen, germanium, silicon)
2. COLLECT by moving INTO extractors (walk onto them to collect)
3. CRAFT at ASSEMBLER: change vibe to heart_a, then move into it
4. DEPOSIT at CHEST: change vibe to heart_b, then move into it
5. RECHARGE at CHARGER when energy < 40

=== ENERGY RULES (CRITICAL) === ⚠️ RECHARGE AT 40 ENERGY - don't wait until critical! ⚠️ If energy < 20, you CANNOT use
silicon extractor (costs 20) ⚠️ When low on energy, RETURN to a known charger - don't wander searching ⚠️ Every move
costs 1 energy - plan your routes efficiently

=== VIBES ===

- heart_a: craft hearts at assembler
- heart_b: deposit hearts at chest
- default: recharge at charger, collect from extractors

=== EXPLORATION STRATEGY ===

- Explore in a SPIRAL pattern, not straight lines
- **When you SEE an extractor, PURSUE IT as top priority!**
- When you find an extractor, USE IT before moving on
- If you've gone 10+ steps in one direction with no new extractors, CHANGE DIRECTION
- Remember where you found chargers - return to them when low on energy
- Try all 4 directions from spawn - don't just go one way

=== NAVIGATING AROUND WALLS === The map has walls/obstacles. When blocked:

- Don't just reverse - try a PERPENDICULAR direction to go around
- If moving East and blocked, try North or South, then resume East
- Keep the target direction in mind and work around obstacles
- Walls are temporary barriers, not dead ends
