# Example configuration for enabling curriculum server in distributed training
# This allows multiple worker nodes to fetch tasks from a centralized curriculum server

defaults:
  - default

# Enable curriculum server for distributed training
curriculum_server:
  enabled: true
  port: 5555  # Port for the curriculum server
  batch_size: 100  # Number of tasks to fetch in each batch
  
# When enabled:
# - Master rank will start a curriculum server on the specified port
# - All ranks (including master) will use curriculum clients to fetch tasks
# - The server maintains all curriculum state and logic
# - Clients randomly select from their task batch

# This is useful for:
# - Ensuring consistent curriculum progression across all workers
# - Centralizing curriculum statistics and logging
# - Reducing memory usage on worker nodes
