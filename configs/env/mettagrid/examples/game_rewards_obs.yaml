# Example configuration showing how to enable game_rewards global observation
# This adds a packed representation of resource rewards to agent observations

defaults:
  - /env/mettagrid/arena/basic@
  - _self_

game:
  # Enable game_rewards global observation
  global_obs:
    game_rewards: true
  
  # The game_rewards observation packs rewards for these resources:
  # - ore (any ore type)
  # - battery (any battery type) 
  # - laser
  # - armor
  #
  # Each reward is quantized to 2 bits:
  # - 0: reward <= 0
  # - 1: 0 < reward <= 0.5
  # - 2: 0.5 < reward <= 1.0
  # - 3: reward > 1.0
  #
  # The packed byte format is:
  # Bits 7-6: ore reward
  # Bits 5-4: battery reward  
  # Bits 3-2: laser reward
  # Bits 1-0: armor reward
  
  # Example reward configuration
  agent:
    rewards:
      ore_red: 1.0      # Will be quantized to 2
      battery_blue: 0.3 # Will be quantized to 1
      laser: 0.8        # Will be quantized to 2
      armor: 1.5        # Will be quantized to 3
