# MISSION BRIEFING: Operation HEARTS

## Holon Enabled Agent Replication System

### Welcome, Cog Team!

You are part of an elite unit of Cogs deployed to establish and maintain critical HEARTS infrastructure in this sector.
Your mission: navigate the grid, collect vital resources, and manufacture as many hearts as possible while defending our
facilities from Clip infestation.

---

## YOUR CAPABILITIES

### Power Management

- Your onboard battery stores limited **energy** - use it wisely!
- Solar panels provide passive recharge during operations
- Support your teammates: Move into an ally's position to transfer energy from your reserves to theirs
- Many actions and facility operations require energy expenditure

### Action Protocol (One Action Per Turn)

**MOVE [Direction: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, or Last]**

- Empty space → You relocate to that position
- Occupied space → You interact with the target:
  - Another Cog → Transfer some of your energy to them
  - Facility → Activate or operate the facility (see Interaction Protocols below)
- Some movements consume energy from your battery
- "Last" repeats your previous movement direction

**DISPLAY [Symbol]**

- Update your visual communication display
- Symbol remains visible to all Cogs until changed
- No energy cost
- Use for coordinating protocols, warning of threats, or team strategies

**THINK**

- Hold position and process tactical data
- No movement, no energy expenditure
- Useful for timing coordination or conserving energy

### Interaction Protocols

- To interact with any facility: Position yourself adjacent to it, then MOVE toward it
- You become the **activator** if you're first to interact this turn
- Facilities may have **cooldown** periods - patience required between uses
- Multi-Cog operations: Some facilities need teammates at specific **terminals** (the 8 positions surrounding the
  facility)

### Cargo & Equipment Specs

Your chassis has limited capacity for:

- **Essential Resources**: Carbon, Oxygen, Germanium, Silicon
- **Specialized Equipment**: Resonator, Modulator, Scrambler, Disruptor
- **Mission Objective**: HEARTS units
- **Energy** reserves (for transferring to facilities or teammates)

---

## FIELD OPERATIONS

### Resource Acquisition

Locate and operate extraction facilities by moving into them:

- **Carbon Collector** - Harvests carbon compounds
- **Oxygen Optimizer** - Processes atmospheric oxygen
- **Germanium Generator** - Extracts germanium deposits
- **Silicon Smelter** - Refines silicon materials
- **Energy Emitter** - Charges the activating Cog's battery

**Operating Instructions**: Move into the facility from an adjacent position. Resources or energy will be added to your
cargo if successful.

### The Atomic Assembler - Heart Production Center

This is your primary objective facility! The Assembler converts raw resources into equipment and precious HEARTS units.

**CRITICAL PROTOCOL SYSTEM**:

- Position teammates at specific terminals around the Assembler
- The activating Cog moves into the center
- Different formations unlock different protocols!

Example formations:

```
.C.     (Protocol Type Alpha)
CBC
...

.C.     (Protocol Type Beta)
CB.
..C
```

**Protocol Execution**:

1. Surrounding Cogs must possess required input resources
2. Activator moves into Assembler
3. Resources are consumed from the team
4. Output (equipment or HEARTS) goes to the activator
5. Discovery required - protocols change between missions!

### The Communal Chest - Strategic Storage

**To Deposit**: Position yourself at specific terminals and move into the Chest **To Withdraw**: Position yourself at
different terminals and move into the Chest

- Experiment to discover which positions trigger deposits vs withdrawals
- Primary storage for completed HEARTS units

---

## THREAT ADVISORY: CLIP CONTAMINATION

**WARNING**: Hostile Clips are actively attempting to infest our facilities!

### Clip Response Actions

- **Identify**: Clipped buildings have altered appearance
- **Approach**: Move adjacent to the infected facility
- **Unclip**: Move into the facility to attempt special unclipping protocols
- Different Cog formations may be required for different unclipping procedures
- Act quickly - Clips drain resources from infected buildings!

### Infestation Patterns

- Spreads primarily between nearby deposits
- Assemblers and Chests have resistance but aren't immune
- Infestation rate may accelerate over time or come in waves
- Left unchecked, Clips will fully consume a building

---

## MISSION PARAMETERS

### Success Metrics

- Personal inventory: Each HEART in your cargo = 1 point
- Team achievement: Each HEART in the Communal Chest = shared points among all Cogs

### Operational Constraints

- Actions execute in unspecified order each turn - coordinate accordingly
- Facilities may only activate once per turn (first mover wins)
- Cooldown timers must expire before reactivation
- Resource deposits become less productive with use
- Some protocols may require specific equipment in addition to resources
- Protocol availability may change based on facility status

---

## TEAM COORDINATION PROTOCOLS

### Essential Teamwork Actions

1. **Energy Support**: Move into low-battery teammates to share power
2. **Protocol Formation**: Position around facilities before activation
3. **Communication**: Update DISPLAY symbols for silent coordination
4. **Resource Relay**: Form chains to efficiently move resources
5. **Clip Response**: Coordinate unclipping formations rapidly

### Tactical Recommendations

- Designate energy donors and facility operators
- Use THINK action to synchronize complex maneuvers
- Display symbols for: "Need Energy", "Ready", "Danger", "Wait"
- Scout for new protocols through systematic formation testing
- Maintain defensive positions near critical facilities
- Protocols may be keyed multiple ways - experiment!
- Some buildings support up to 256 distinct protocols

### Protocol Discovery Guidelines

- Document successful formation patterns
- Note which terminals require occupation
- Track input/output resource requirements
- Share discoveries via display communication
- Remember: protocols vary between missions

## FINAL DIRECTIVE

**Your mission is critical. The HEARTS you create today will ensure the continuation of Cog operations tomorrow.**

Success depends on:

- Efficient energy management
- Strategic facility operations
- Rapid Clip threat response
- Continuous protocol discovery
- Seamless team coordination

_Stay charged. Stay coordinated. Stay vigilant._
