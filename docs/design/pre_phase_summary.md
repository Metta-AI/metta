# Pre-Phase Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-09-03  
**Status:** Complete ✅  
**Time Taken:** ~1.5 hours  

## Overview

The Pre-Phase successfully added the missing callbacks needed for the hook architecture while maintaining minimal footprint and maximum clarity.

## Callbacks Added

### 1. `on_rollout_end`
- **Location:** Called after rollout phase completes, before training begins
- **Purpose:** Allows hooks to process rollout results before training
- **Data Available:** `rollout_stats` populated in TrainerState
- **No existing alternative:** There's no pre-existing callback at this critical junction

### 2. `on_epoch_end`
- **Location:** Called after epoch increment, outside training timer
- **Purpose:** Allows hooks to perform end-of-epoch operations (checkpointing, metrics)
- **Data Available:** `loss_stats`, `eval_scores`, checkpoint URIs
- **Why Not Use `on_train_phase_end`:** That callback happens BEFORE epoch increment, inside training timer

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`metta/rl/trainer_state.py`**
   - Added 9 new fields for hook data sharing
   - Used TYPE_CHECKING to avoid circular imports
   - Proper type hints for all fields

2. **`metta/rl/loss/base_loss.py`**
   - Added `on_train_start()` method
   - Added `on_epoch_end()` method
   - Both with empty default implementations

3. **`metta/rl/trainer.py`**
   - Added callback invocations at appropriate points
   - Populated TrainerState fields before callbacks
   - Moved loss stats collection to before `on_epoch_end`

4. **`tests/rl/test_trainer_callbacks.py`**
   - Created comprehensive unit tests
   - Verifies all callbacks and fields work correctly

### TrainerState New Fields

```python
# Hook-related fields for data sharing
rollout_stats: dict[str, list[float]] | None = None
loss_stats: dict[str, float] | None = None
eval_scores: EvalRewardSummary | None = None
experience: Experience | None = None
policy: PolicyAgent | None = None
latest_checkpoint_uri: str | None = None
latest_wandb_uri: str | None = None
stats_tracker: StatsTracker | None = None
timer: Stopwatch | None = None
```

## Callback Flow

The complete callback sequence in the trainer is now:

1. `on_new_training_run` - Once at training start
2. `on_rollout_start` - Before each rollout phase
3. **`on_rollout_end`** ✨ NEW - After rollout, before training
4. `on_mb_end` - After each minibatch
5. `on_train_phase_end` - After training phase completes
6. **`on_epoch_end`** ✨ NEW - After epoch increment

## Design Decisions

### Why `on_rollout_end`?
- No existing callback covers this critical junction between rollout and training
- Rollout stats need to be processed before training begins
- Natural pairing with `on_rollout_start`
- Clear and descriptive naming

### Why Keep `on_epoch_end` Separate from `on_train_phase_end`?
- Different timing: `on_train_phase_end` is INSIDE training timer, before epoch increment
- `on_epoch_end` is OUTSIDE training timer, after epoch increment
- `on_epoch_end` has access to updated epoch count and collected loss stats
- Critical for checkpointing and metrics which need complete epoch state

### Minimal Footprint Approach
- Only added 2 new callbacks (absolute minimum needed)
- Checked thoroughly for existing alternatives - none found
- Reused existing patterns from BaseLoss
- No changes to existing loss implementations (backward compatible)

## Testing

All tests pass successfully:
- TrainerState has all new fields
- BaseLoss has new callback methods  
- Callbacks can be invoked without errors
- Data is properly populated before callbacks

## Next Steps

With the Pre-Phase complete, the foundation is ready for Phase 1:
- Create hook infrastructure
- Build on these callbacks
- Hooks will use the populated TrainerState fields

## Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level:** LOW ✅
- **Backward Compatibility:** MAINTAINED ✅
- **Performance Impact:** NEGLIGIBLE ✅
- **Code Complexity:** MINIMAL INCREASE ✅

The implementation successfully balances the need for extensibility with maintaining simplicity and clarity.
