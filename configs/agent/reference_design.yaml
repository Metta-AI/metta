# List each component of your agent below. Component code can be found in
# agent/lib, or you can write your own and reference it under _target_.
#
# Components must have their name as their top-level attribute. The input_source
# is also necessary but can be set to null. The output_size is necessary unless
# it is defined by the size of the input source. Do not enter an input_size
# as it's defined by the input_source's output_size.
# Necessary sources: _obs_, _core_
# These interact with the trainer in a special way and use custom classes.

# Necessary outputs: _action_type_ and _value_ (and _action_param_ if MultiDiscrete)
# You must have layers with these names, and their output sizes must correspond
# to your action and value space. They can otherwise be any class that works
# with MettaAgent.

# Components are nn.Modules. Linear and Conv modules get extra weight helper
# functions found in the ParamLayer class.
# ***Note that these layers are also
# appended with a nonlinear layer unless you specify nonlinearity: null.
# Nonlinear layers should be specified as nn.<nonlinearity>, such as nn.Tanh.

# There are also merge layers that allow you to merge multiple outputs into a
# single output to feed into a layer. You can merge in various ways, such as
# concatenating (DenseNet), summing (ResNet), taking the mean, etc. You can
# also take slices of a single output to feed into a layer.

# Go through the components below to find additional examples.
