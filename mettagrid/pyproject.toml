# Note: if you decide to use `editable.rebuild` here, consider that it's not
# compatible with isolated builds.
#
# That's because isolated builds produce a `build` directory that refers to the
# temporary isolated environment, which doesn't exist anymore by the time the
# rebuild is triggered by scikit-build.
#
# We could enable uv's `no-build-isolation-package` option, but it creates its
# own issues (we'd have to install build dependencies manually).
#
# So for now we're recompiling the entire package on every C++ code change.
