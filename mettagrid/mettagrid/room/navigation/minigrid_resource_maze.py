"""
MinGrid-Inspired Resource Maze Environment

Inspired by MinGrid's maze environments and ObstructedMaze. This creates a maze-like layout
with walls forming corridors and dead ends. Generators and altars are scattered throughout
the maze, requiring exploration to find and collect resources.

Original MinGrid Maze envs: Agent navigates through maze to reach goal, avoiding dead ends.
MettagGrid adaptation: Agent navigates maze to find and collect from generators/altars.

The environment consists of:
- Maze-like layout with wall corridors and dead ends
- Generators scattered throughout for resource collection
- Altars placed strategically for heart rewards
- Multiple possible paths with varying difficulty
